About B2B Growth
+ B2C you have to be shiny
+ B2B enterprise buyer takes the decision. They look for solving a problem, for efficiency, for utility. And they are not the users.
+ This starts to break down now!
+ B2B decision get pushed down to pro-sumer ... The employee making that decision.
+ its getting more in direction of effectiveness ... making the life of the employee better
+ about customer centricity
+ build for the buyer, but also build for the user
	+ onboarding, time to value, activation experience, habit loops
	+ affinity, NPS
	+ example Slack, Miro ... people bring that into their company!!
+ Product Led, Marketing Led, Sales Led
+ Product Led
	+ How to acquire?
	+ How to retain?
	+ How to monetize?
+ Bottoms up
	+ Leverage usage to generate leads for sales  (sounds like B2C2B)
+ Product Led is a version of bottoms up
	+ the product generates the leads
	+ banking on the hand raisers
+ where are you product led applying too
	+ acquisition
	+ retaining
	+ monetization
	+ all?
+ you need to first focus on product led for retention
	+ activation and
	+ engagement via habitual loops
+ relationship type
	+ 1 - to -many  ... product led is growth
	+ 1:1 connection
+ community, word of mouth
+ you need to go find the buyer
+ Product led sales
	+ starts with some form of usage
	+ on top - you analyze where a whole organization could benefit from it
		+ you qualify people by behavior, use cases, demographics
	+ sales comes into ply ... hand raiser event ... and sales is closing it
	+ go via outbound
+ trial ... time to try is often varying for people ... so adjusting to a trial date range is often really difficult. You alienate large enterprises with time based trials
+ make a usage based freemium
+ ... high friction products
+ trial is strictly for POC
+ always have something free and self service
+ What is the reason for having freemium?
	+ Does it help my indirect monetization
	+ Does 
	+ Does it help my Aha moment?
	+ Does is create habit loops (e.g. notification)
+ We need to think about the growth models at play
