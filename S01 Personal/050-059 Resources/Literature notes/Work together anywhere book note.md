# Work together anywhere book note
Work together anywhere;Lisette Sutherland - short notes

Motivation & self discipline
Have a set routine in the morning
Dress like you‚Äôre going to work
Work in a space designated for work
Set a schedule and stick to it
Productivity
Don‚Äôt overwork yourself - take care of yourself and take time off when you need it
Sit for 20‚Äô stand for 8‚Äô and move around for 2‚Äô -- so stand up, sit less, move more
Minimize multitasking;instead focus on one thing at a time
Communication
‚ÄúIf you think your‚Äôre overcommunicating, you‚Äôre doing it right‚Äù
Be overtly friendly and assume positive intent. Practice positive communication approaches
Don‚Äôt send faster than you can receive and don‚Äôt send faster than the other person is sending
Inform your colleagues on how best to be reached when - maintaining your status updates
Try more advanced visual communication - video chat, virtual office technology (Sococo, Walkabout Workplace) ‚Ä¶ minimize background noise and maximize your visual presence
Post your activities online so everyone can see what you‚Äôre doing
Have video conferencing open all time with muted mics and unmute/ask a question when needed
Meet just as often - online
Work out loud: make work visible
Use online task board (Jira, Confluence-Realtime editing, Miro Whiteboards)
Trust and relationships
Building blocks of trust are being reliable, consistent and transparent‚Ä¶ so even more we need to deliver the results we committed to and make that work visible
Make sure your teammates know what you‚Äôre working on and how to reach you
Offer some of your personality to the team, however subtly or overtly we go about it
Grab a virtual coffee or lunch with the mates on your virtual team
Stop making assumptions and start asking questions. Be curious.
As soon as an interaction starts to get heated, ditch the written word and pick up the phone or turn on the webcam
Meetings
Use video as much as possible
ELMO - enough, let‚Äôs move on
Good lighting and (if possible) silent background
Consider recording for people who cannot attend
Have same early/late socializing time included
Define how people can show that they want to speak up (e.g. hand sign, extra card,...) and how the facilitator can acknowledge that
Visualize the discussion (e.g. in Asana, Confluence, Miro and shared with everyone simultaneously)
Keep presentations at a minimum
Share up front what can be conveyed in writing
Mute when not speaking
Disable tones and announcements
Cool signals https://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Live-lesson-cards.pdf
Establish environment of mutual appreciation and praise effort rather than ability
Use a parking lot for questions to ask (that can wait a little longer)
