[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1VXTaoSY0U)

+ Assessment should be abandomned
+ Let children use AI
+ give homework with integrating AI
+ free ChatGPT-4o is changing the game
+ it still needs skill and people with skill can outperform with AI immensifly
+ AI can act like a personal tutor - so it amplifies individual learning by 2 sigma
+ Google Gems (similar to GPTs)
+ language learning gets doomed
+ Notebook LM - can build an audio journey about something to learn and you can live change the path of it ... crazy

## ðŸ’¡ Idea corner
+ I need to understand the problem of current teachers better - as they might be another audience to connect with regarding learning. They need to understand AI and how to integrate that in their day-2-day. But I need a teacher as a hub to build that understanding
	+ working with GPTs for specialized answers
+ I need to upskill on proper use of AI on devices - eg. working with images
