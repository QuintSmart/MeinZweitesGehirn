Not dismiss ‚ÄúGet Rich Quick‚Äù as improbable. Not allow the Slowlane to bury my dreams. Not allow Slowlane prognosticators to contaminate my truth with their dogma. ‚Äî location: [6108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004BDOUAI&location=6108) ^ref-61437

---
Not ordain the Slowlane as the plan, but let it be a part of the plan. Not sell my soul for a weekend. Not expect nor seek a chauffeur to wealth. Not trade my time for money. Not put time in control over my financial plan. Not forsake control over my financial plan. Not demote time as abundant and effervescent. Not assign faith to events, but to process. Not take advice from gurus who preach one roadmap, while getting rich using another. Not use compound interest for wealth, but for income. Not disrespect the passivity of a dollar. Not cease learning at graduation but start it. ‚Äî location: [6109](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004BDOUAI&location=6109) ^ref-8269

---
Not impose the burdens of parasitic debt into my life. Not play on Team Consumer, but switch to Team Producer. Not dismiss the plausibility of my dreams. Not chase a path of money, but a path of need. Not fuel my motivation by love, but by passion, purpose, and why. Not focus on my expenses, but on my income. Not pay me last, but first. Not do what everyone does. Not trust everyone but allow trust to be proven. Not relinquish control over my business. Not hitchhike but seek to drive. Not operate within limited scales and in tiny habitats. ‚Äî location: [6115](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004BDOUAI&location=6115) ^ref-55508

---
Not dishonor the horsepower of my choices. Not swim as a guppy in a pool, but as a shark in the oceans. Not consume first, but produce first, and consume later. Not partake in barrier-free or entry-weak businesses. Not invest in other people‚Äôs brands, but in my own. Not give credence to ideas, but to execution. Not forsake my customer for other stakeholders. Not build a business, but a brand. Not focus my marketing messages on features, but benefits. Not be a polygamist opportunist: Focus! Not operate my business like checkers, but chess. ‚Äî location: [6120](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004BDOUAI&location=6120) ^ref-7912
