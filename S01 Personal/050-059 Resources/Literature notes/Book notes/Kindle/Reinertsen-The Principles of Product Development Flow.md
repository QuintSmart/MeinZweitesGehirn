## Highlights
Among other things, this paradigm emphasizes small batch transfers, rapid feedback, and limited work-in-process inventory (WIP). — location: [142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=142) ^ref-37245

---
FIFO prioritization is almost never economically optimal in product development, because product development deals with high variability, nonrepetitive, nonhomogeneous — location: [148](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=148) ^ref-22188

---
For example, if we combine the belief that efficiency is good, with a blindness to queues, we will load our development process to high levels of capacity utilization. — location: [156](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=156) ^ref-48752

---
High capacity utilization may cause queues, but these queues have no apparent — location: [158](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=158) ^ref-3867

---
We will blindly embrace concepts like Six Sigma product development. — location: [161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=161) ^ref-17605

---
Today, developers focus on what we call proxy variables. A proxy variable is a quantified measure that substitutes for the real economic objective: life-cycle profits. For example, developers measure development cycle time and seek to make it shorter. However, when you ask them how much life-cycle profit will decrease due to a week of delay, they don’t know.1 Cycle time is only a proxy variable. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=180) ^ref-53193

---
This unit of measure should be life-cycle profit impact, which is the ultimate measure of product development success. — location: [188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=188) ^ref-57635

---
Few developers realize that queues are the single most important cause of poor product development performance. — location: [191](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=191) ^ref-59232

---
When cycle times are long, innovation occurs so late that it becomes imitation. — location: [195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=195) ^ref-54361

---
If we ask the chief financial officer how much inventory we have in product development, the answer will be, “Zero.” — location: [197](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=197) ^ref-57521

---
how big are our queues? Today, only 2 percent of product developers measure queues. Second, what is the cost of these queues? — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=204) ^ref-16546

---
how queue size translates into delay cost, which requires knowing the cost of delay. — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=205) ^ref-1640

---
Then, if we seek to minimize total cost, we will only focus on the portion we can see, the efficient use of capacity. — location: [215](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=215) ^ref-14600

---
creates enormous costs in the unmeasured, invisible portion of the product development process, its queues. — location: [219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=219) ^ref-54459

---
deeply flawed for three important reasons. First, without variability, we cannot innovate. — location: [227](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=227) ^ref-65027

---
design, we introduce uncertainty and variability in outcomes. We cannot eliminate all variability without eliminating all value-added. — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=229) ^ref-6582

---
Minimizing the economic impact of variability is a profoundly different goal than minimizing variability. — location: [240](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=240) ^ref-57377

---
To manage product development effectively, we must recognize that valuable new information is constantly arriving throughout the development cycle. — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=250) ^ref-17802

---
we must learn to make good economic choices using this emerging information. — location: [251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=251) ^ref-43144

---
will be completely overwhelmed by the geometric increase in uncertainty caused by the longer planning horizons associated with large batches. — location: [258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=258) ^ref-16768

---
A flow-based process delivers information on a regular cadence in small batches. — location: [269](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=269) ^ref-57776

---
But these 200 drawings were not completed in a single day. They may have been completed over a 10-week period. The first 20 drawings to be completed may have waited 9 weeks to be reviewed. — location: [274](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=274) ^ref-60231

---
But how do we prevent all these small review meetings from driving up overhead? We conduct these review meetings on a regular time-based cadence. Every Wednesday afternoon at 1:00 pm, we review all the drawings completed in the last week. There is no need for a meeting announcement and no need to coordinate schedules. — location: [278](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=278) ^ref-57693

---
Meetings that are synchronized to a regular and predictable cadence have very low set-up costs. — location: [280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=280) ^ref-25447

---
We will discover how cadence helps to control the progressive accumulation of variability in development processes. — location: [282](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=282) ^ref-55299

---
The more detailed we made our plans, the longer our cycle times became. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=289) ^ref-32439

---
We favor highly granular planning because we don’t understand the statistics of variability. — location: [289](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=289) ^ref-17057

---
Even worse, if we incentivize conformance, people will insert contingency reserves to prevent their tasks from missing the schedule. — location: [293](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=293) ^ref-36858

---
queues are leading indicators of future cycle-time problems. — location: [297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=297) ^ref-31160

---
One of the most powerful ways to manage queues is to use WIP constraints. — location: [300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=300) ^ref-7988

---
In pursuit of efficiency, product developers use specialized resources loaded to high levels of utilization. — location: [314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=314) ^ref-10007

---
responsive in the presence of variability. To do this, we must make resources, people, and processes flexible. — location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=320) ^ref-32670

---
We value flexibility, and we pay for it. In contrast, most product development organizations exclusively reward specialization. — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=322) ^ref-57172

---
In general, it is best to delay the project with a low cost of delay. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=332) ^ref-25988

---
This suggests that we should not prioritize on the basis of project profitability, but rather on how this profitability is affected by delay. Of course, this can only be done when we know the cost of delay, information that 85 percent of developers do not have. — location: [332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=332) ^ref-22443

---
Our central premise is that we do product development to make money. — location: [354](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=354) ^ref-62564

---
When we focus on observable phenomena, we can be biased by the fact that some characteristics are more observable than others. — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=360) ^ref-36187

---
In fact, what you can observe visually tells you little about the way a radio functions. For this, you must understand the signals flowing through the system. — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=368) ^ref-48838

---
Critical process choices with great influence on economics, such as inventory levels and feedback loop design, are virtually invisible. — location: [371](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=371) ^ref-33722

---
The issue is not queues, it is the economics of queues. Rather than saying queues are universally bad, we must treat them as having a quantifiable — location: [382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=382) ^ref-956

---
We will discover that reducing batch size is usually the single most cost-effective way to reduce queues. — location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=393) ^ref-58963

---
Instead, we will look at lessons that can be learned from telecommunications networks and computer operating systems. Both of these domains have decades of experience dealing with nonhomo-geneous and highly — location: [415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=415) ^ref-62585

---
The speed of feedback is at least two orders of magnitude more important to product developers than manufacturers. — location: [417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=417) ^ref-25059

---
Feedback allows us to efficiently adapt to unpredictability. — location: [421](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=421) ^ref-58593

By breaking the betting process into two steps, the overall bet produces a net gain of 45 cents. — location: [433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=433) ^ref-30370

In its most advanced form, today’s military combines decentralized control with alignment. — location: [446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=446) ^ref-58837

---
Instead, the side that can thrive in the presence of uncertainty is most likely to win. — location: [491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=491) ^ref-63470

---
Small batches have lower risk, are less expensive, and they produce faster results. They accelerate learning. — location: [521](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=521) ^ref-20868

---
So, start small, and start quickly. — location: [531](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=531) ^ref-20926

While you may ignore economics, it won’t ignore you. — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=541) ^ref-3056

Why do we want to change the product development process? The answer: to increase profits. — location: [543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=543) ^ref-13179

---
There is simply no way to compare things that lack a common unit of measure. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=548) ^ref-21981

---
Ask them to independently estimate what it would cost the company, in pretax profit, if their project were 60 days late to market. — location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=550) ^ref-59001

---
As we shall see later, when high-quality decentralized economic information is absent, it is too often replaced by the mind-numbing bureaucracy of centralized control. — location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=554) ^ref-53304

---
They are a means to influence overall economic outcomes, never an end in themselves. — location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=557) ^ref-35594

---
An early move to manufacturing saves us 4 weeks of cycle time, but it raises the cost of correcting defects from $2,000 to $20,000. The critical question is whether 4 weeks of cycle time savings will pay for this $18,000 of extra cost. If so, we should push the immature product onto the factory floor. — location: [575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=575) ^ref-50367

---
know the magnitude of the change, and most importantly, we need a method to express all changes, in all variables, in the same unit of measure. — location: [587](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=587) ^ref-49803

---
quantified using a standardized and useful unit of measure: life-cycle profit impact. — location: [601](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=601) ^ref-48850

---
If you only quantify one thing, quantify the cost of delay. — location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=603) ^ref-3513

---
The project manager is actually trading cycle time for variability. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=608) ^ref-580

---
we quantify both the value of cycle time and the economic benefit of reduced variability. — location: [609](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=609) ^ref-36073

---
We should also point out that COD, and other sensitivities, can be computed for any milestone, not just for the final milestone of the project. — location: [615](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=615) ^ref-40080

---
There, it is popular to say that an informed customer is the sole judge of value-added. This view is both economically incorrect and dangerous. — location: [623](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=623) ^ref-5781

---
in the price that an economically rational buyer would pay for a work product before, and after, the activity is performed. — location: [624](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=624) ^ref-27717

---
We can define waste as the failure to optimize our economics. — location: [636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=636) ^ref-39560

---
We can only make this trade-off correctly when we convert both forms of waste into the same unit of measure: life-cycle profit. — location: [639](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=639) ^ref-45984

---
Making all forms of economic waste visible changes our view of product development. — location: [641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=641) ^ref-59707

---
But, making activities more efficient is much less important than eliminating inactivity. — location: [643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=643) ^ref-2000

---
not unproductive engineers, but work products sitting idle in process queues. — location: [644](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=644) ^ref-14464

---
This practice led to excess inventory, low quality, high overhead, and long cycle time. — location: [652](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=652) ^ref-65008

---
Pay attention to the work product as it lies idle in the queues between activities, not just to the busy workers. — location: [655](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=655) ^ref-7905

---
product development, our problem is virtually never motionless engineers. It is almost always motionless work products. — location: [659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=659) ^ref-31699

---
Such U-curves are common in multivariable problems. — location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=665) ^ref-51291

---
contrast, U-curve optimizations virtually always require quantification, because we must balance two or more competing factors. — location: [669](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=669) ^ref-1191

---
U-curves have flat bottoms, so missing the exact optimum costs very little. For example, in Figure 2-2, a 10 percent error in optimum batch size results in a 2 to 3 percent increase in total — location: [673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=673) ^ref-19168

---
We want to make better economic choices than we make today, and today, this bar is set very low. We simply do not need perfect analysis. — location: [679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=679) ^ref-25627

---
With an economic framework, we can normally bring this range down to 2 to 1, a 25-fold improvement. — location: [683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=683) ^ref-18674

---
not let fear of inaccuracy prevent you from creating economic frameworks. — location: [687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=687) ^ref-12964

---
We overmanage this 20 percent, and undermanage the other 80 percent. — location: [695](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=695) ^ref-65332

---
For example, consider the problem of cycle time in a traditional factory. Such a factory might take 100 days to do what a lean factory could do in 2 days. Where was the extra 98 days? Was it in two or three big 30-day queues? No! It was actually caused by 98 little 8-hour delays. Each individual delay was too small to manage, — location: [696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=696) ^ref-19931

---
Many economic choices are more valuable when made quickly. — location: [720](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=720) ^ref-19365

---
It follows that if most opportunities and obstacles are first visible to people at the lowest level of the organization, then this level should be able to make these decisions. — location: [724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=724) ^ref-6250

---
Finally, we should recognize the nonmonolithic nature of our decisions. Most of our decisions can be decomposed into component parts that individually have distinct economics. This means that we can often isolate a good choice inside a bad one. — location: [730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=730) ^ref-15239

---
They had found the economically attractive good choice hidden inside the bad choice. — location: [740](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=740) ^ref-32022

---
Decompose the choice into its pieces and keep the good parts. — location: [741](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=741) ^ref-13918

---
They recognize that the cheapest opportunities to buy cycle time appear early in the development cycle. — location: [752](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=752) ^ref-39659

---
Such decision rules accomplish four things. First, they align all the economic choices on the entire project. Second, they ensure that these choices are optimum at the system level. Third, they enable us to push control down to low levels with limited risk. Finally, they streamline the process of making decisions. — location: [765](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=765) ^ref-52061

---
By dramatically reducing the marginal effort required to make good economic choices, they make it possible to control many more decisions. — location: [767](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=767) ^ref-47003

---
The combined impact of these four effects is astonishing. We can make more decisions, faster, more easily, more correctly, and with less risk. — location: [768](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=768) ^ref-52948

---
If we make resources available for free, they will tend to be infinitely utilized. — location: [790](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=790) ^ref-5170

We are likely to overpay if we buy our ticket either too early or too late. — location: [813](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=813) ^ref-2126

decision at the point where further delay no longer increases the expected economic outcome. — location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=818) ^ref-60837

---
Instead of waiting for the “last responsible moment,” we can recognize that the cost of certain decisions can rise steeply past a certain point, or that the value created by waiting may have stopped increasing. — location: [820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=820) ^ref-57831

---
The term “marginal” refers to the amount by which parameters change when we make very small changes in other parameters. — location: [827](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=827) ^ref-31958

---
When one considers marginal economics, however, the picture changes. We might discover that the small increase in value cannot be justified when compared to the extra expense and cycle time necessary to add that feature. — location: [835](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=835) ^ref-16503

---
The economic question is whether that last 5 percent is truly worth the expense and cycle time that will be consumed. — location: [844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=844) ^ref-23110

---
Money we have already spent is a “sunk cost” and should not enter into an economic choice. We should make the choice on marginal economics. — location: [848](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=848) ^ref-20489

---
Low-cost activities that remove a lot of risk should occur before high-cost activities that remove very little risk. — location: [869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=869) ^ref-22920

The optimum number of parallel paths occurs when incremental value equals incremental cost. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=888) ^ref-6573

What would happen if drug companies filtered out all molecules with less than a 50 percent chance of success? Such aggressive filtering, before acquiring sufficient information to make a good economic choice, would eliminate all uncertain and poorly understood opportunities. — location: [910](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=910) ^ref-14579

---
When we make much more money from success than we lose from failure, then we should be willing to invest in opportunities that have considerably less than a 50 percent chance of success. This problem appears to be better understood by economists than by observers of product development. — location: [915](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=915) ^ref-5242

When we speak to those who control the money, using the language of money, we can get fast decisions and enthusiastic support. — location: [920](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=920) ^ref-56957

Of all our decision rules, the one that most transforms our thinking is the one that is missing today in most companies, a quantified cost of delay. — location: [931](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=931) ^ref-42329

The pattern with which work arrives, which is usually unpredictable, is known as the arrival process. — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=961) ^ref-53446

The time it takes the server to accomplish the work may also be unpredictable. This is known as the service process. — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=961) ^ref-40882

We handle waiting work in a certain sequence, such as first-in-first-out (FIFO). This sequence is known as the queueing discipline. — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=962) ^ref-23748

This way of labeling a queue is known as Kendall notation. It is named after the British statistician David Kendall, who first used it in 1953. — location: [964](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=964) ^ref-39495

This simply means that short inter-arrival times are more probable than long ones. This is also known as a memoryless arrival pattern, because each arrival is statistically independent from the next. — location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=967) ^ref-5735

Instead, developers assume that their cycle times will be faster when resources are fully utilized.

Even worse, because these queues are invisible, there are no natural predators keeping them under control. — location: [1001](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1001) ^ref-51865

First, queues increase cycle time. It takes longer to reach the front of a large line than a small one. By quantifying cost of delay, we can attach a specific financial cost to this queue time. Usually, delay cost rises linearly with queue size. — location: [1007](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1007) ^ref-49904

Do you measure cycle time, and do you measure queues? The answer: 100 percent of product developers measure cycle time, and about 2 percent measure queues. When 98 percent of product developers do not even measure queues, we have an important problem. — location: [1033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1033) ^ref-9293

The percent of time arriving work will find the resource busy. The average number of items in queue. The average number of items in the system. The percent of overall cycle time that is queue time. The ratio of cycle time to value-added time. — location: [1052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1052) ^ref-9485

---
We can use capacity utilization to predict queue size and cycle time, and we can also use queue size or cycle time to calculate capacity utilization. This property is quite useful from a practical perspective, because it is often very difficult to directly measure capacity utilization in product development processes. — location: [1060](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1060) ^ref-34221

---
The probability that we will find two units in the queue is 75 percent of the probability that we will find one unit in the queue. However, delaying two units creates twice the delay cost. — location: [1078](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1078) ^ref-59289

---
This means that over time, the less probable state of a two-unit queue does 150 percent of the economic damage done by a one-unit queue. — location: [1079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1079) ^ref-29342

The coefficient of variation is a measure of variability that is computed as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean of a probability distribution. — location: [1090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1090) ^ref-28668

---
this means that queues vary linearly with variance, a point worth remembering. — location: [1092](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1092) ^ref-1887

So, be very cautious if you think you can solve the problem of queues by reducing variability. — location: [1103](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1103) ^ref-20165

---
For example, a change in loading at 95 percent utilization produces a cycle time impact that is 25 times higher than the same change in loading at 75 percent utilization. — location: [1112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1112) ^ref-24577

---
Thus, when product developers choose to operate their processes at high levels of utilization, they create unnecessary and wasteful variability in their processes. It is important to realize that this variability is a self-inflicted wound. — location: [1113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1113) ^ref-8222

If there is one queue per server, a single bad job can block everything behind it in the queue. — location: [1124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1124) ^ref-29967

---
Unfortunately, one queue per server structures are very common in product development processes. Such structures lead to unnecessarily large queues. — location: [1127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1127) ^ref-47610

---
In effect, the queue can function as a buffer isolating the variability of the arrival pattern from the departure pattern. — location: [1140](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1140) ^ref-56647

---
This, in turn, is important because highly variable arrivals generate what are called “shock waves” — location: [1143](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1143) ^ref-26160

In fact, flow through a bottleneck is affected strongly by the process that precedes the bottleneck. — location: [1154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1154) ^ref-31788

---
To do so, we must calculate the total cost of our process, combining the cost of capacity and the cost of the queue, and determine where this is minimal. — location: [1162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1162) ^ref-39005

If either cost of delay or cost of capacity change, the optimum point for our U-curve changes. — location: [1173](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1173) ^ref-34879

In product development, our goal is to reduce the economic cost of queues, not simply to reduce the size of queues. — location: [1182](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1182) ^ref-7490

---
By changing the sequence in which we service the jobs in the queue, we can significantly reduce the cost of the queue. — location: [1184](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1184) ^ref-40170

---
Under such conditions, the only way to reduce queue cost is to reduce queue size. — location: [1186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1186) ^ref-19174

---
Our jobs have different delay costs, and they block resources for differing amounts of — location: [1189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1189) ^ref-65322

it is better to service the one with the highest delay cost first. If two jobs have the same cost of delay, it is better to process the shortest job first. — location: [1190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1190) ^ref-47919

high cost of delay before low cost of delay, and short jobs before long jobs. — location: [1193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1193) ^ref-49334

If we simply determine the amount of DIP in each process stage, we can divide this by the average completion rate and determine the cycle time through each stage of our process. — location: [1248](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1248) ^ref-60602

we can also compute the delay cost for each stage. — location: [1250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1250) ^ref-527

Even queues with no delay cost do economic damage. They delay feedback, add overhead, reduce quality, and raise variability. — location: [1256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1256) ^ref-60992

---
But where do we get queue time? There are two relatively easy ways to obtain it. First, we can compare queueless cycle time for a process with average cycle time. — location: [1258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1258) ^ref-19486

---
Mark a job as a “hot lot” and give it preemption privileges in all queues and processes. It will experience no queue time, so its cycle time is 100 percent service time. Compare this with average cycle time and the difference is queue time. — location: [1260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1260) ^ref-43757

---
second approach is to calculate average service time by dividing a department’s applied hours by its throughput. Then queue time is simply the total processing time minus service time. — location: [1261](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1261) ^ref-64175

---
For example, if the process applies 40 hours a week and completes 10 jobs, then each job receives 4 hours of processing. If average cycle time through this process is 40 hours, this process has 10 percent value-added time and 90 percent queue time. — location: [1263](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=1263) ^ref-17890

Many supermarkets cross-train check stand operators to perform other tasks. These stores monitor the size of queues at check stands. As soon as they have more than three customers in line, they open up a new check stand. When the queues are cleared, they close the extra check stand.

Again, we must remind you that queues create long planning horizons. When queue sizes are large, it takes a long time for work to flow through a system.

The simplest way to use a WIP constraint is to block all demand when WIP reaches its upper limit. — location: [2360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=2360) ^ref-54942

The second way to block demand is to hold back the job in an upstream queue. This does not actually reduce demand, it just shifts the location of the queue. Such an approach can actually generate economic benefits if different queues have different holding costs, — location: [2364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=2364) ^ref-47224

We can then target a specific flow-through time for each category of work and use Little’s Formula, Principle Q12, to determine its WIP limit. — location: [2530](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=2530) ^ref-59988

As Figure 7-1 shows, this throughput can be decomposed into two factors: the traffic density (vehicles per mile) and the traffic speed (miles per hour). The product of these two factors is flow, or throughput. — location: [2643](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=2643) ^ref-32157

When we cram too many projects into the product development pipeline, we create queues.

One of the more subtle effects of fast feedback is its ability to shrink queues. Fast feedback loops enable a process to operate with less WIP. — location: [3367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=3367) ^ref-64851

How do we compensate for any variability that accumulates before this feedback signal takes effect?

variability that accumulates in less than one round-trip time.

Civilian firefighting organizations also create virtual centralized capacity. Fire departments in adjacent communities provide mutual support. This permits a community to cope with infrequent large fires without having a large fire department. — location: [3845](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=3845) ^ref-35293

Thus, when military force is being focused, we subordinate all other activities to the main objective. — location: [3867](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=3867) ^ref-1237

---
Therefore, we need to dynamically reallocate resources to produce a compelling advantage on a handful of key attributes, not a modest advantage in all areas. — location: [3872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=3872) ^ref-36610

Depending on the nature of the military operation, from one-third to one-half of the force will be held in reserve. — location: [3976](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=3976) ^ref-25039

In offensive operations, the Marines believe in making early contact with opposing forces. — location: [3989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=3989) ^ref-7403

Projects must apply meaningful effort to judge how severe the risks are and whether they can be overcome. — location: [3994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=3994) ^ref-30246

It is critical to focus these early efforts on zones of high technical or market risk. — location: [3996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=3996) ^ref-51629

requires decentralizing both the authority to make decisions and the information required to make these decisions correctly. — location: [4003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4003) ^ref-6246

If time on the critical path is worth a lot of money and a support group is on the critical path, this support group should be measured on response time, not efficiency. — location: [4021](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4021) ^ref-62419

---
A straightforward way of moving in this direction is to create a quality of service agreement that spells out the response time that users can expect from the department. — location: [4025](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4025) ^ref-42892

---
There is no additional price for premium service from internal support groups, so all users request premium service. This creates infinite demand for premium service — location: [4033](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4033) ^ref-49781

---
One interesting variant of this is to allow users to buy premium service with a limited number of tokens rather than money. — location: [4038](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4038) ^ref-58606

---
Offering a limited number of tokens is like controlling the money supply. The tokens can be exchanged for valuable services. — location: [4043](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4043) ^ref-36387

---
First, initiative is self-reinforcing. Second, the easiest way to build the cohesive groups that enable decentralized control is to use colocated groups that can engage in face-to-face communications. — location: [4045](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4045) ^ref-51553

The more we encourage initiative, the more chance we have to provide positive reinforcement for this initiative. The more chances people have to use initiative, the more they will feel this is not a risky thing to do. — location: [4052](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4052) ^ref-56527

primarily based on experience, it follows that we can increase trust by maintaining continuity in our teams. — location: [4079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4079) ^ref-60052

Furthermore, as we move to small batch size activities, we expose team members to more cycles of learning. — location: [4079](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4079) ^ref-13077

Centralized control works well for problems that are infrequent, large, or those with scale economies. — location: [4087](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B007TKU0O0&location=4087) ^ref-49494
