# Notes from Do things that don't scale
[Podcast episode: Do things that don't scale](https://music.amazon.de/podcasts/57b86aa4-1c8a-4d55-a43a-b9a68306377d/episodes/14f58666-6df7-4cef-b9b5-85c415ca2374/masters-of-scale-1-airbnb's-brian-chesky-do-things-that-don%E2%80%99t-scale)

Brian Chesky - Co-Founder of AirBnb, Reid Hoffman - Host of Masters of Scale, Co-Founder LinkedIn and autor of [*Blitzscaling*](https://www.blinkist.com/en/app/books/blitzscaling-en) and [*The Startup of You*](https://www.blinkist.com/en/app/books/start-up-of-you-en)

Emphasis on handcrafted work in the beginning.

First ==do things that don't scale at all==. Stop thinking big, start thinking small.

Problem with investor needs and promising them big numbers.

==Go to your users and get to know them one by one!== And make something directly for them.

Home visits become secret business for AirBnb ... as they were able to ask tons of questions to the users. 

Peer-to-peer system and work closely with the users.

==The roadmap often exists in the mind of your users.== Passionate feedback is a glue that shows that users care about your product. 

Extract detailed feedback.

==What could we do to surprise you? (So that you tell every person about it)==

What would a 6-star experience be? What is a 7-star experience? 10-star, 11-star?
[[The 11 star framework]]


Design the extreme and come backwards.

Need to differentiate edge case input.

Design to get the total doable things done first.

Later - What is the easiest thing that we can automate?

Meet the demand that users express ... so what the user is asking for. Implement a piecemeal process.

Pay very close attention to your users.

Transition to scaling is a challenging one. You still need to have a mindset to consider each individual user but at the same time look at the overall one.

Designing experience is different to scaling experience

Scaling experience:
+ highly analytical
+ operations oriented
+ technology oriented
+ prune, distill, architect

Designing experience:
+ intuition based
+ human
+ end-2-end

You need to bring your team along. And listen carefully to critics from employees.

Never fully abandon the hand crafted mindset. And there are many reasons that a scaling organisation will reject handcrafted approaches. ==Leadership must protect new hand crafted movements.==

Great story of how to transform via an experience. 
+ Start in ordinary world ...
+ Leave ordinary world and cross obstacles enter the new magical world
+ ==They overcome something. They are on the hero's journey==

+ Dream big, act small
+ Pay passionate attention to your users, and hand craft core service to them
+ Create a magical experience
+ and learn what part of that can scale.
