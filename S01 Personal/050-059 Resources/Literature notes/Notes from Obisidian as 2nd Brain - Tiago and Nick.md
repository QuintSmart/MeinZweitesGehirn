+ Obsidian provides us with a map of notes and tells us a story, where we can look for connections and analyze the gaps between notes
+ visual and spatial arrangement
+ importance of Map of Contents comes into play
+ Use the MOC as your center
	+ Dump all relates notes in your Map
	+ Start grouping into related notes
	+ Group first , headline later
	+ put own stuff to the top
+ now map the gap
	+ headlines
	+ you discover the need for more information
+ it can always change .. and MOCs make that easy
+ met level - make an evergreen note
	+ something with really important insights
+ behavior based repetitions - matches that show up while taking notes
+ switch on backlinks! Work more with backlinks
+ link up from evergreen note to the MOC too
