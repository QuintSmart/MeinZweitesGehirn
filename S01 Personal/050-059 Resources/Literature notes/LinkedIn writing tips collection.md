## Problem-Agitate-Solve Formula  
  
This formula is a classic for a reason.  
  
‚Ä¢ Identify a problem your audience faces.  
‚Ä¢ Agitate the problem by highlighting pain points.  
‚Ä¢ Offer a solution that positions you as the expert.  
  
Example:  
"Struggling to get noticed on LinkedIn? Your posts might be lost in the noise. Here's how to stand out and get the engagement you deserve."

## Before-After-Bridge Formula  
  
Show your audience the transformation.  
  
‚Ä¢ Describe the current situation (Before).  
‚Ä¢ Show what life looks like after your solution (After).  
‚Ä¢ Explain how to get there (Bridge).  
  
Example:  
"Before using these copywriting tips, my LinkedIn posts were ignored. Now, they drive tons of engagement. Let me show you how."

## Curiosity Gap Formula  
  
Create intrigue to draw readers in.  
  
‚Ä¢ Present a compelling headline or question.  
‚Ä¢ Leave out just enough information to pique curiosity.  
‚Ä¢ Deliver the answer in your post.  
  
Example:  
"Why do some LinkedIn posts go viral while others flop? The secret lies in one simple trick."
