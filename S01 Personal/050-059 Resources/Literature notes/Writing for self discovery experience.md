## What do I value most in relationsships?
I like when I can show up with my complete self in a relationsship andbuild that on a layer of trust and mutual respect. I my peer knows me and undrestands what I'm talking about. And when my peer is actually interested in what I'm sharing and shows that with questions, engagement, feedback, providing a counter opiniion a. There is a component of being able to follow inleeectually on a topic. But here I learned that there is a differences in relationsships. For expert exchanges I need to search for expert exchanges, that actually are knowledgable in that field and share a common passion. A good example was the Wardley mapping experience, where until today I did not find a proper peer to really talk through that. Actually I wonder why that happened, likely because it might cost money and it is also a journex where I actually did not know where to start and also how much I can ask for. In addition I did not have the strongest use cases for working on a Wardley map.
What I would like to get out of these exert conversation is cross pollination, a challenge on my way of thinking and further claritiy on how to apply the method.
There is a different type of relationsship that is more build on love, being close emotional and physically. This is e.g. the relationsship with my wife. In this relationsship I value the emotional component. So understanding me deeoply as a person, the way I behave, the way I solve, the way I appear, the way I smell, cloth - really the way I am. I makes me feel understood. It provides me an environment where i can let go. And it also is a corrrective on my behavior and calls me out, when I'm getting too much in a direction thatputs me in a corner, where I would lose the compatibility with others. And this relationsship also provides sexual satisfaction. An important aspect too. What is for me tightly coupled but I'm aware that there are also models that actually separate that.
And there is another type of relationship - with my closest relatives, like my children. Here I value the mirror and also the option to provide knowledge on their mental growth and topic growth. It such a special connection and access to the mind of a peer. I value their partially radical candor honesty. I value that they consider arguments stronger then from many other areas. And they also help me to value what I achieved in my life. AS my chidren are carrying my learnings and behavior too
Another form of relationsship are with close friend. This is often based on some share experiences and I value to have these common experiences and living though that with friends again and again. At the same time, friends also open me the world to a wider spectrum of what life means. Its not work and it is not family. It is their topic and world, through that I can discover what matters to them and likely to me too. And through that disocvery I can learn in new dimension. Theses relationsships foster serendipity and help me not getting stuck And they also provide a reflection point, thorugh that I can learn what works, where I'm successful - in comparioson, and what I might bemissing. I value that these releationsships aslo force me to develop further.


## How do I show compassion to others?
HWen I truly listen and try to understand their perspective and situation. And when I stop myself from providing hints immediately. Partially it is then later on also coupled with providing my life long learning to get people unstuck and trying a different way. But through my coaching education I also learned that people have huge resources they can unleash and that showing my ideas might stop them from really connecting to their powers. 
I also learned that accepting and welcoming emoitions is important. And that it connects to my body and through that I can interprete much butter what an emotions might be about and where it is coming from. I think I can sesne emotions in others well and with my knowledge around emotions I can also help others working through emotion. Accepting, welcoming and working with the message an emotion provides is something that helps me with compassion - to others and also to myself. 
I have difficulties with compassion when I interprete that as being lazy and not applying own resources to solve a topic. For that point I have an innner onflict - from coaching I would have to build on the fact, that people behave at a time with their best abilitities and will they can apply at this moment. Partially I'm then judgemental and would do better in rethinking and connecting to their situation. It provides a better level of empathy to work with have persepective in mind and try to access these perspectives. 
I can elverage that form of compassion - to emotional awareness and connecting with best aims even more to myself. 

## How can I better support and appreciate my loved ones?
I can increase my momental awareness throughout the day and provide small little singals, signs that I'm aware of their presessence and being and that I'm happy to have my loved ones with me.
I can even more calm down in tough situations and apply my emotional awareness and empathy building in theses situations. 
I can support by helping to their important need. E.g. my wife is in an education atm and I can support more with removing the other sidework. Actually I need to check with her, if she wants that oo, of if that is a welcome change to switch tasks. 
I can support with taking again a little more of the householding work, like cooking and cleaning. I declined a bit recently, so I should be aware of that. 
I think we also need to spend a little more pair time, going for lunch,...

With my children - I should ask them, what they would wish for. At the moment I think they are just fine and run through their lifes. And I'm there when they might need help, but I actually do wait for their call. I might support more, but actually I'm not there regarding time invest and mutual benefits. I'm not sure how much value mid children would get from it and how much I would be willing to bring more to the table.

## Three things I would like to tell a friend, colleague, family member, partner
