# Simplicity
Elements of Simplicity
--
What is the thing that is missing that would allow my users to proceed to the next step?

* **Time** - how long it takes to complete an action
* **Money** - the fiscal cost of taking an action
* **Physical effort** - the amount of labor involved in taking the action
* **Brain cycles** - the level of mental effort and focus required to take an action
* **Social deviance** - how accepted the behavior is by others
* **Non-routine** - How much the action matches or disrupts existing routines

### Questions one may ask
--
Is the user short on time? 
Is the behavior too expensive? 
Is the user exhausted after a long day of work? 
Is the product too difficult to understand? 
Is the user in a social context where the behavior could be perceived as inappropriate? 
Is the behavior simply so far removed from the userâ€™s normal routine that its strangeness is off-putting?
