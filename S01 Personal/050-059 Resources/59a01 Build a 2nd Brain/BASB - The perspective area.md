# BASB - The perspective area

**==We only know what we make==**

## The perspective era
> [!important]
> **==The perspective is the distinction==**. It is my unique set of experience that let's me look at information different to all others.
> 
> It is important to **==know how make sense of information==** and work with technology to process that effectively.


### A brief history trail to the perspective area
1) **time** became the **most scarce resource**
2) then we ran out of time ... and landed in the **attention era**
	+ measured in eyeballs
	+ required constant new creatives
3) we ran out of attention - **==now we enter the perspective era==**
	+ have an opinion about **what matters** 
	+ perspective as **holistic understanding**
	+ perspective includes **wisdom and awareness of our own position**

### Increase awareness with a Perspective Map
My perspective map captures what my my unique perspective is. It helps me to **identify the lenses I'm seeing the world through**.
