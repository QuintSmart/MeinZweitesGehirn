	* Follow me?
	* Send me a connection request?

## LinkedIn Headline
+ most important asset
+ use with one-sentence elevator pitch
+ I am ... who helps ... to do ... 
+ or even better: Helping ... to ...
+ most attracting ... removing a pain and helping them to achieve a specific result

Look at LinkedIn headline formulas Pdf
[[LinkedIn Headline Examples.pdf]]

## Description
+ tell visitors more about you
+ about 300 characters will be visible first
+ use it as an extension of your headline
+ who are you able to help?
+ which problem do you solve?
+ which results can I help them to achieve?
+ bottom part
	+ contact information
	+ where can people get more information about me
	+ links to additional social media accounts and URL of business website
	
## Contact information
+ contact or intake forms that allow you to ask a couple of questions to qualify potential leads

+ avoid LinkedIn messaging system

## Call to Action
+ what action should visitors take after they informed about me
+ e.g. Download, Follow,...
+ repeat multiple times in the profile
	+ profile description
	+ different sections e.g. experience, education, projects
	+ in each media file


## Media
+ use media files in your profile
+ LinkedIn creates previews
+ should contain a call to action
+ pattern
	+ intro about the content
	+ external link with additional information
	+ primary call to action and contact information

## Professional experience
+ tell a coherent story
+ put recent achievements top of your story
+ what skills are still important for my current narrative and how I want to be perceived. Link to the right page
+ include important key words - what would someone type to a google search?
+ put important and impressive things first

## Educational experience
+ mention you most impressive achievements
+ make it easy to understand where you're coming from
+ demonstrate that you have lazor focus on your goal

## Skills
+ up to 50 skills
+ act like tags 
+ only top three skills will be displayed
+ make sure to put most important skills on top (and regularly check that)

## Recommendations
+ prioritize on quality and relevancy
+ invest in long and thoughtful recommendations
+ https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastiankamilli/detail/recommendation/write/

## Accomplishments
+ super important
+ publications, articles,...
+ courses I have taken
+ test scores
+ projects I have taken
+ live what you preach
+ what you create and share shows your professional attitude

## Linkedin pages
+ have very low reach
	+ people prefer person to person connection
+ you play traffic to them
+ they lower traffic on pages to push you into advertising

## LinkedIn Ads
+ not recommended
+ one of the most expensive way to advertise
+ CPC about $5
+ only working for really expensive items
+ sponsored eMail very similar

## LinkedIn Automation
+ LinkedIn Sales navigator
+ send automated messages
+ bad responses
+ filters are not really precise
+ automated messages sound horrible
+ LinkedIn banned these tools - and they will lock down the account when they discover that you are using it

## Promotional Content
+ LinkedIn does not like external content
	+ they want content that keeps you in the platform
	+ gives really low reach per LinkedIn
+ LinkedIn can also already detect promotional content better and better

## Engagement pods
+ group of people who join forces to play the LinkedIn algorithm
+ cross engaging with like, comments
+ often creates very mixed signals from people from different industries that LinkedIn cannot interprete
+ really bad strategy

## Avoid Viral Non-Business-Topics
+ non business topics
+ feel good theme - you alienate a certain kind of people
+ you will attract the wrong people


Always tie back to business context!
30000 connection limit on LinkedIn
Only connect with people whom you want to do business with

## About groups
+ are often unmanaged with a lot of spam in it
+ users get used to low quality content
+ often too much content
+ engagement low .. indicates to LinkedIn that it is bad content
+ with own groups - content is only limited to that group


# Understanding the algorithm
+ want you to stay on the platform as long as possible
+ help LinkedIn show they ads and create sales for LinkedIn
+ linkedin article features
+ help users to have a great experience
+ likes, comments, shares heavily increase reach
+ push on normal regular text posts ...
	+ for users who prefer reading
	+ photos posts
	+ media posts
	+ live streaming
+ aim to create LinkedIn native content
+ you can build up momentum based on content on consistent basis
+ favors non promotional content

## Need to have the Sales funnel in place
![[Pasted image 20240116201952.png]]

+ content and encourage to follow, then send them subscription links to other topic 
	+ have a lead magnet available .. give it away for free in exchange for their contact information
	+ create high quality content to promote the lead magnet
	+ nurture the leads

![[Pasted image 20240116202435.png]]

PIMP your profile
+ forms digital first impression!

## The one post per day system
+ creates best results on LinkedIn
+ if you create more posts per day, this does not help as you impressions get shared
+ if content performs, then maximum impressions increases
	+ but goes away when you start sharing bad content and content that leads to external sources
+ mentioned 1h for creating a good post

## Relationships
+ whom do I want to build relationships with
+ it is wrong to go straight to a call
	+ better build more personal relationships
	+ have an invisible sales funnel in place for users to self-qualify as leads

## Content types
+ external linkes
	+ worst content type of all
	+ some providers are whitelisted
	+ better share links via a comment
+ articles
	+ attempt to keep people on the platform
	+ is not really maintained and reach has dropped a lot
	+ no real benefit of using that
	+ you can create a summary from a post and route people to that article
		+ you get not punished by routing from a post to an article
+ text posts
	+ **think about the first 3 lines that is shown to the people first!!**
	+ structure that flow is organically --- follow the thought process of someone
	+ read out aloud and see if you can follow the flow ... is the connection between the sentences obvious
	+ empty lines between sentences is helpful to structure content
	+ make reading it as easy as possible
	+ have one call to action at the end of each post - follow, connect, engage
+ photo posts
	+ have average engagement today 
	+ with people celebrating something and showing emotions (happy) work well
+ video posts
	+ now video posts
	+ best type of videos
		+ not yet a cover image - need to insert a fame in beginning 
		+ ![[Pasted image 20240119174154.png]]
	+ include sub-titles - helps reading (often videos are on autoplay and without audio)
	+ show value proposition in first 3 lines of text too
	+ as much watch time as possible is important
		+ put the delivery at the end and promise the delivery in the beginning
		+ ask for engagement with your content
+ live streaming
	+ highly prioritized in 2021, high amount of expressions
	+ Q&A sessions
	+ 5-10' mini presentations. Tell story from different angles
	+ encourage to ask questions
+ documents
	+ above average rating
	+ slideshare near to dead now
	+ cheat sheets and summary work well
+ poll
	+ connect with business objective
	+ how do answers help you with their answers

* Don't expose your political preferences
* Don't write to technical - phrase in common terms
* Don't write to personally (divorce, death, birth,...)
* Don't write about mental health issues
* Fake feel good stories
	* they are not true
	* they change anything
## Good topics
+ customer pains
	+ how can you help with the pains
+ customer results
	+ case study, testimonial, test result, outcome of using your story, reviews, awards
+ industry news - give your take on that and how can that be applied in your business ...
+ personal stories - to communicate a principal in your business
	+ so give it a business spin
+ smart rants
	+ ![[Pasted image 20240119195208.png]]
	+ keep it personal and ligthheart
	+ provide a solution
+ smart controversial (spiky point of view)
+ praise
	+ employees, customers, peers, speakers, podcast/youtube episodes
	+ be 100% genuine, believe in it
+ gratitude - on special occasions and not overdo that
+ events - where you habe been, what you learned and tag other attendees
+ secret knowledge - give them the big picture and teaser and how that might help them
+ announcements - major updates, pricing changes, BF info

## Mistakes
+ not relevant for the audience
+ overly promotional content -- instead use 70-80% for value and 20% promotional content
+ being boring
	+ way of writing
	+ topic itself
	+ irrelevant and can't be connected with reality
+ bad spelling and grammar
+ hashtag stuffed post ... keep hashtags less than 3 in total
	+ discover what hashtags actually have followers
+ brand inconsistent voice
+ call to action only posts - without reasoning 
+ not having a point or specific purpose in your post
	+ instead build on 80% content + transition + call to action
	+ each post needs a specific purpose and your audience should take ONE desired action
+ not getting to the point

## How to create killer content 
+ find great topics
	+ BuzzSumo, Reddit, Twitter, SemRush (super important Websites), HashTags
+ turn a topic into many posts
+ create a content workflow
+ follow the structure of a good post
+ use hashtags wisely
+ use best days and times to post

### create a mind map 
Create a mindmap and drill down to topics to write about

+ Medium - 1000 characters, 10m video
+ Long - 2500+ words, 15-30m video

## Hook your audience
+ in first 10 seconds
+ add a great promise that you audience wants DO or DIE
	+ something they want to know, learn or are curious about
	+ bold statement in first line to teaser

![[Pasted image 20240121064538.png]]

### Headline
+ use as less words as possible
+ break expectations
+ why should your audience care about it
+ ask questions that triggers curiosity

![[Pasted image 20240121064835.png]]

Add a qualifier
![[Pasted image 20240121064912.png]]

Tell something people really care about in your headline. Communicate why something is important for me.
