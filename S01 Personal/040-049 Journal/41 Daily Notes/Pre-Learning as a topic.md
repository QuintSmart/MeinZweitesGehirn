# Pre-Learning as a topic

Richard asked me, if we can prepare for learning. If there are teasers that activate the learning. 

- What two thoughts come up?
Is a bridge to connect to the topic. And not just move fast and paying not enough attention to a topic. 

- What two questions would you ask?
This opens curiosity. To explore the unknown. 
To understand a topic. To explore what is clear, and what needs further learning.

- What two emotions come up?
Create a deeper connection, to either open more curiosity or explore why me might reject a topic.
