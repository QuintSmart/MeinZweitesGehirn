## Goal for today

## The story of the day
*If I had to tell a story from today - a five minute story onstage about something that took place over the course of this day - what would it be?*


## Done today (Obsidian based)

### Current Pact
My follow-up PACT (next 10 days, until 25.03):

4. Integrate Pomodoro planning into morning routine
