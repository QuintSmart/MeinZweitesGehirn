+ [sign-off status assessment](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOmjqD2s=/?moveToWidget=3458764529201948083&cot=14) + short alignment on positioning
	+ I have sufficient clarity what initiatives/opportunities we start with for Blinkist Connect
	+ I have sufficient clarity on the OKRs for Blinkist Connect
	+ This is my level of confidence that we reach the OKRs
