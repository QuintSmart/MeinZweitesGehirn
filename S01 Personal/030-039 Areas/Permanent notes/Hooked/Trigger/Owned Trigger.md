# Owned Trigger
Owned triggers consume a piece of real estate in the user’s environment.

For example, an app icon on the user’s phone screen, an e-mail newsletter to which the user subscribes, or an app update notification only appears if the user wants it there.

**The trigger owns a share of the user’s attention.**
