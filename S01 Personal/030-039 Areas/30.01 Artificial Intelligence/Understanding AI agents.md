* [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT), [HuggingGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17580), Toolformer, ChatGPT Plugins,  [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)
* AI agents allow language models to connect to tools, other models and itself, giving it the ability to interact with the outside
* accomplish more complex tasks, without requiring the user to design a complex prompt
* [Toolformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) was a research breakthrough from Meta's AI
* ChatGPT only gets what OpenAI calls a "manifest" file that tells ChatGPT what is possible with that tool.
* AI agents will 10-100x the complexity of tasks we can delegate.
* "chaining" GPT and tools together with frameworks like [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)
