# Creator Copy Matrix
<aside> 💡 “You are an expert ghostwriter who specializes in LinkedIn and Twitter marketing and you have years of business experience. Please analyze the following 10 posts from **(𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑠 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎 𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑓 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑚 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒).**

I want you to give me 2 new posts based on these posts. Please make the posts with the thought leadership of **(𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒)** and the formatting and copywriting skills of **(𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒),** with a slight influence from **(𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑜𝑟 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒).** I want you to make the sentences short and concise but also switch up the formatting so it's enjoyable to read. Please: no hashtags, and please make sure the posts follow this opening format:

A bold statement that is no more than 8 words in sentence one.

A short statement beginning with "How I" and then a number included in this story's opening sentence.

Here are the 10 posts to analyze:

**(𝐼𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑟 10 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑠 ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒)**

</aside>

Our work isn't done.

We need 1 more prompt to get the correct tone of voice.

<aside> 💡 “Can you please add the following story to both posts:

**(𝐼𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡 𝑎 𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑦𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡 𝑡𝑜 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑠)**

Keep the integrity of both original posts, but just make them longer and add elements of this new story and lesson into the posts:”
