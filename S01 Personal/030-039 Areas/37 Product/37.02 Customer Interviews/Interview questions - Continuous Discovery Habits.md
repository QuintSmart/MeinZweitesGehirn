# Interview questions - Continuous Discovery Habits
**Ask indicative rather then predictive questions:**

Ask indicative rather then predictive questions:

**e.g. How many cases similar to … ?     Instead of: Will this case …?**

  

Test ideas on small scale…

10 minutes … 10 months … 10 years

What would I recommend that my best friend should do?

  

Compare and contrast the impact of mapping one opportunity vs. another one.

  

Ask in the direction of How a user actually does it? Instead of: How a user thinks she does it.

  

We struggle to answer direct/factual questions… We are bad at quantifying how often we do something…

We speculate about why/what/when we did something.

You will not know if they are telling you a coherent story that sounds true but isn’t true in practice.

  

**You need to understand the customers actual behavior - their reality - not the story they tell themselves.**

  

Distinguish research (what you want to learn) vs. interview questions (what you ask in an interview)…

  

What needs, pain points, and desires matter most to this customer?

  

**Ask them to share specific stories about their experience…**

Tell me about the last time you purchased a pair of jeans…?

  

Broader questions help to uncover new opportunities…

  

**Ask them to share their fully story with you…** to share as many details as possible, leave nothing out. And ask for missing details…

Ask along temporal prompts … What happened first? What next… What happened before that?

  

**What challenges did you encounter? How did you overcome that challenge?**

  

**When they ask for a specific feature … ask why they need that and capture the opportunity…**

**If you had that feature .. what would that do for you?**

Example: „I wish I could just day the name of the movie I’m searching for…“  … ask What would that do for you … „I don’t want to have to type out a long movie title“

  

  

——

Tell me about a specific time when…

  

For expressed feelings … capture the cause for these feelings

  

-   Testing the assumptions that need to be true
-   Look for confirming and disconfirming evidence for the assumptions

  

Assumption: What must be true in order to generate value for our customer?

Desirability - „Our subscriber wants to watch sports on our platform“…

Viability: People who watch more minutes are more likely to renew…

  

Addressing this opportunity will drive the desired outcome because…

We are confident that this opportunity is a users opportunity when …

This solution addresses the target opportunity because…

  

Phrase assumptions such that you need them to be true: „Customers will remember their passwords“ instead of „Customer’s won’t remember their password“ … this makes it easier to test

  

Many assumptions can be tested with quick answers to a single question…

E.g. Assumption: Our subscribers want to watch sports … When was the last time you watched a sporting event?

Please select all the sports you’ve watched in the past month…
