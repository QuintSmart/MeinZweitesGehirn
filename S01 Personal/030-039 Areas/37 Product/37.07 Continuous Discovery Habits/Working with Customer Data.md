# Working with Customer Data

We also don’t know who else needs that feature
This happens because **customers don’t always know the best solution** for their own needs

It’s rare (I’ve never seen it) to meet a salesperson who is trained in story-based interviewing who can collect the full context behind a feature request.

**Behavioral analytics** are an amazing window into our customers’ behavior. That window can tell us what our customers are doing, but it **can’t tell us why they are doing that**.
However, these inputs are **great inspiration for what to explore in your upcoming interviews**

**If customers are requesting a feature over and over again, interview them**. **Ask them what they are doing that is creating that need.**

Find out **what they are doing when they experience that pain point**

You can also **get the full context by observing** your customers

**Limiting the opportunities on your opportunity solution tree to the ones that you were able to explore firsthand in interviews or that you were able to observe firsthand yourself.**
