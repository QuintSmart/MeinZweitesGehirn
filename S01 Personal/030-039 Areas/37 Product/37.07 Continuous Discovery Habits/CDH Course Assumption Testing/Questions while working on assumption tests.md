# Questions while working on assumption tests
+ Does it make sense to connect a 1 question survey with measure the impact on behavior based just on the survey question? 
	+ Example: 
		+ Assumption: People find more possible peers to share with when they remember their huge community on their social networks
		+ Assumption Test: Have you shared a book or podcast you read in the past 6 months with someone in your social networks? Yes: With how many?  ... combined with a Data Mining: Did this question lead to people sending an invite afterwards.
+ I tend to phrase opportunities based on problems that users have with a solution we provide them. But I thought that opportunities should be connected with a solution solving the underlying problem. I'm not sure about the nesting here.
	+ It seems like these could also be phrased as assumptions directly
