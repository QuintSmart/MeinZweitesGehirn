#  1) Current learning career and trajectory
I'm an curious explorer and I'm learning because it motivates me and supports me in solving topics in my professional career as Agile Coach and Product Coach. 

# 2) The learning aim that is of importance to me
Currently I support with building cohort based courses and want to drill down more on the topic of learning an making learning stick. This will help me to create better courses and help the learner to create outcomes that they want and then tie back to time spent well.

# 3) Biggest mental challenges in achieving your learning aim
Actually I don't think of having a mental challenge here. I'm really curious, I work with my Second Brain and just learn about learning. Maybe procrastination, or at least partially dilluting of my focus could be a topic. 

# 4) Outline existing research or learning techniques that are relevant to your challenges
+ I'm using [Building a Second Brain](https://digital-garden.ontheagilepath.net/moc-building-a-2nd-brain) as my main approach for capturing, organizing, distilling and expressing my learnings. 
+ I apply atomic habits (James Clear) and various techniques for habit forming for each topic that I want to cover and bring into my life. Also connected with Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal
+ I'm a big fan and implementor of Mindset: Changing The Way You think To Fulfil Your Potential by Carol Dweck
+ I apply Getting Things Done by David Allen combined with Journalling and Personal Kanban by Tonianne DeMaria Barry und Jim Benson

# 5) Applying knowledge of research findings or learning techniques to help me overcome my challenges
I do integrate the learnings from the course immediately in my Second Brain. Parts of the learnings get published in my [Digital Garden](https://digital-garden.ontheagilepath.net/). And I'll apply learning improvements in my cohort based courses. In addition my wife does study on a topic at the moment and I do immediately transfer my learning to then learn together and apply that to her learning journey too.
