+ [Ebbinghaus forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve)

consistency bias.

Absent-mindedness means you’re not paying enough attention to the task at hand, so incoming information is either partially encoded or not at all.

Being asked leading questions about past memories can actually change what we remember

you do know the answer – the only issue is that it’s being blocked.

absent-mindedness is an entirely different kind of memory failure

we are highly suggestible when it comes to remembering past events.

misattribute things we’ve seen in different situations

the next sin: misattribution.
