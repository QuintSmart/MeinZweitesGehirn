# Important LinkedIn aspects shared by Lara and Jasmin
![[Pasted image 20240227133855.png]]

+ Who is seen liking it matters too ... connected with the Halo effect
+ My profile headline matters more outside of my profile - first 45 characters are crucial
	+ appears in main feed, every comment and recommendations
+ Reposting 4/6hrs later - benefit from content being shown twice - delete repost after 24hrs to keep feed clean.    (need to observe what they mean by reposting)
+ post in direction of what you want to be ... eg post yourself as a speaker, posting about one thing that you want to become connected with
+ DM someone who should see the post on that day - the algorithm pushes content to people you messages recently
+
