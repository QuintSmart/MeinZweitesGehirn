[Amount]/[timeframe] = [goal]

That's the goal. Now deconstruct it:

- [Number] sales of a [price] product
- [Number] clients for a [price] service

Now determine lever-moving tasks:

- [Task 1]
- [Task 2]
- [Task 3]

Systemize that^

Example system:

[Action 1]

[Action 2]

[Action 3]

Another way of doing it (if you have [condition])

- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]
- [Step 4]

Now all you have to do is [action]

[Benefit 1] [Benefit 2]

Then:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]
- [Action 3]

[Result], the [number] point [topic] model:

## Story 2

Post Type: Story

I'm the most [descriptor] [person] ever.

- I don't [action 1]
- I haven't [action 2] in [timeframe]
- I don't have [achievement]

Hence my [topic] strategy is pretty [descriptor] too:

- [Strategy 1]
- [Strategy 2]
- [Strategy 3]

But this [descriptor] strategy has [outcome].

So if you are [emotion] to [action] because you think your [element 1], [element 2] or [element 3] are [descriptor].

I suggest you [advice].

Cos [topic]'s not about being [quality].

It's about being [emphasis]
