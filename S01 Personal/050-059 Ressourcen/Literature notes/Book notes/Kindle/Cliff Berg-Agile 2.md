don't actually want to self-organize! I want someone to get us organized so that I can code! I just want them to let me code the way that I want ‚Äî location: [850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=850) ^ref-23397

---
‚ÄúI don't actually want to reach out to others for ad hoc discussions! I only do that as a last resort if I am really stuck.‚Äù ‚Äî location: [852](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=852) ^ref-15772

---
‚ÄúNot enough attention is paid to technical issues!‚Äù ‚Äî location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=854) ^ref-20325

Maybe some team members can work just fine in a team room, but others cannot. ‚Äî location: [904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=904) ^ref-1765

Some people also find local movement distracting. ‚Äî location: [906](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=906) ^ref-37531

George Mason University, being interrupted for only 60 seconds while concentrating can completely wipe one's short-term memory. ‚Äî location: [918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=918) ^ref-46546

---
Scrum perfectly fits the definition of methodology as a ‚Äúbody of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline‚Äù ‚Äî location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1005) ^ref-3194

---
Leadership Is Complex, Nuanced, Multifaceted, and Necessary ‚Äî location: [1047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1047) ^ref-59172

---
The reason is that a story is generally considered to be something that is defined in terms of its desired outcome, whereas a task is a prescriptive statement of what to ‚Äî location: [1069](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1069) ^ref-7513

---
and therefore how to achieve the outcome. ‚Äî location: [1070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1070) ^ref-8247

---
Your standing can come from being responsible for something, from having authority over something, or from a reputation of respect that precedes you. ‚Äî location: [1105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1105) ^ref-32247

---
Scrum Master lacks any kind of authority, ‚Äî location: [1111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1111) ^ref-62315

---
Their lack of authority makes them unable to make promises or deals on their team's behalf. ‚Äî location: [1111](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1111) ^ref-30547

The Practice of Management, an organization needs an ‚Äúoutside person,‚Äù an ‚Äúinside person,‚Äù and a ‚Äúperson of action.‚Äù ‚Äî location: [1114](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1114) ^ref-63281

---
The Scale Problem ‚Äî location: [1128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1128) ^ref-28032

---
The complexities of scale are what make the scale issue perhaps the most important technical issue today. ‚Äî location: [1149](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1149) ^ref-12367

---
This personal involvement in the organization's products and services seems to be a common characteristic of managers of the most highly successful technology companies today. ‚Äî location: [1186](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1186) ^ref-51052

---
the product delivery technology is not just a supporting function, subordinate to the company's strategy. Instead, it is part of the company's strategy. ‚Äî location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1188) ^ref-6365

---
How the company delivers is as important as what it delivers. ‚Äî location: [1189](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1189) ^ref-41657

---
Instead, it means that everyone needs to take an interest in the entire value stream ‚Äî location: [1219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1219) ^ref-4894

---
the end-to-end sequence of activities that deliver value to customers ‚Äî location: [1219](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1219) ^ref-49418

---
a successful product vision needs to be highly informed about the product, not just its features, but also how the product is built and delivered. ‚Äî location: [1230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1230) ^ref-15896

---
Tech Cannot Be an ‚ÄúOrder Taker‚Äù ‚Äî location: [1232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1232) ^ref-13723

---
‚ÄúAgile burns people out.‚Äù Agile promotes a ‚Äúsustainable pace‚Äù of work, but in many organizations it is a relentless pace, without peaks and lows. ‚Äî location: [1243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1243) ^ref-10477

---
Psychological studies have also shown that pressure, or in fact anxiety of any kind, disrupts decision-making. ‚Äî location: [1253](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1253) ^ref-45368

---
Agile‚Äîin practice‚Äîis set up so that the business and the developers are not partners. The developers take orders from the business. ‚Äî location: [1260](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1260) ^ref-17185

---
There are several problems with this approach. One is that it discourages honesty. ‚Äî location: [1285](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1285) ^ref-47537

---
Scott Ambler has referred to this as green shifting. ‚Äî location: [1286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1286) ^ref-20552

---
‚ÄúLack of candor basically blocks smart ideas, fast action, and good people contributing all the stuff they've got.‚Äù ‚Äî location: [1294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1294) ^ref-56931

---
On the other hand, if the initiative is highly unique, then one cannot define all the tasks up front. ‚Äî location: [1299](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1299) ^ref-40336

---
for a unique initiative is that for something unique, a large portion of the work consists of learning and trying things. ‚Äî location: [1300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1300) ^ref-51708

---
task model is the wrong approach for planning the transformation and for measuring progress. Instead, what works better is to have various ongoing and intersecting initiatives for problem identification, for upskilling, for collaborating about approaches, for creating and refining metrics, and for instituting and refining various practices. ‚Äî location: [1311](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1311) ^ref-64529

---
In fact, they are what Agilists would call practices: they are about how you do things. ‚Äî location: [1320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1320) ^ref-40363

---
The Individual Matters As Much As the Team ‚Äî location: [1334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1334) ^ref-40086

---
the importance of the individual seems to have been lost in the Agile community. ‚Äî location: [1337](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1337) ^ref-59548

---
being different from the team is seen as being a misfit. ‚Äî location: [1348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1348) ^ref-16423

---
People Don't All Work the Same ‚Äî location: [1404](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1404) ^ref-54510

---
Some people work better in isolation, with quiet, and express themselves better in writing. ‚Äî location: [1408](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1408) ^ref-30773

---
Communication about complex topics is a process, not an event. ‚Äî location: [1427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1427) ^ref-54058

---
That is why one of us has used the approach of writing up a white paper, explaining the issues and laying out options, distributing it, and then having a meeting to discuss it. ‚Äî location: [1436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1436) ^ref-16941

---
One of us has the approach of spending a week inviting team members to record and share their ideas in writing anonymously, summarizing the input and sending that out, then asking the group to submit solutions or action items in writing anonymously, and only at the end of the process coming together in person to discuss and prioritize what to do next. ‚Äî location: [1440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1440) ^ref-7917

---
complex issues require structure, and the best way to establish structure is through writing. ‚Äî location: [1451](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1451) ^ref-58502

---
By writing down a structure, the face-to-face conversations become more focused and more effective. ‚Äî location: [1456](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1456) ^ref-9167

---
The Importance of Focus ‚Äî location: [1462](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1462) ^ref-5328

---
groups that collaborate less often may be better at problem solving. ‚Äî location: [1463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1463) ^ref-45711

---
intermittent collaboration‚Äîthat is, collaboration that follows periods in which one has no interruptions‚Äîleads to the best outcomes. ‚Äî location: [1466](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1466) ^ref-48355

---
Ongoing improvements Consensus or decision about an issue A crisis ‚Äî location: [1476](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1476) ^ref-28004

---
Communication about what someone is doing, or challenges they are having, does not necessarily need immediate discussion, so why bring a whole group together for it? It might be better to provide the information in a real-time dashboard or a group message. ‚Äî location: [1479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1479) ^ref-20067

---
The problem is, it wastes everyone's time. Not everyone wants‚Äîor needs‚Äîto know what everyone is working on. ‚Äî location: [1488](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1488) ^ref-32303

---
In Agile 2 there is a principle that goes, ‚ÄúThe whole team solves the whole problem.‚Äù This means everyone on a team needs to understand how things will fit together. ‚Äî location: [1489](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1489) ^ref-49501

---
They all participated in sketching out the solution, but from that point on, they don't need to know the details of each other's progress. ‚Äî location: [1490](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1490) ^ref-50043

---
They only need to know about issues that arise that might affect them, ‚Äî location: [1491](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1491) ^ref-29148

---
definitely need to know if there are any changes in how the overall solution will work. ‚Äî location: [1492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1492) ^ref-59692

---
When someone knows that they are going to be interrupted, they don't start anything that requires them to think deeply. ‚Äî location: [1509](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1509) ^ref-20048

make product developers get certified in secure product development, ‚Äî location: [1545](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1545) ^ref-11279

---
Security and reliability need to be designed in. ‚Äî location: [1552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1552) ^ref-36292

---
To do that, they need to request help from other teams that are familiar with those systems. Thus, the process of sharing knowledge about the organization's information is entirely ad hoc. Is that a good thing? ‚Äî location: [1571](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1571) ^ref-39477

---
does it not make sense to establish that there is a universal shared view of that information? ‚Äî location: [1573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1573) ^ref-14037

---
If an organization has good leadership, everything else will follow. If an organization has bad leadership, no methodology or set of rules will save ‚Äî location: [1642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1642) ^ref-8161

---
This is why leadership is the core issue for understanding how a group of individuals can work together effectively. ‚Äî location: [1660](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1660) ^ref-25228

---
Authority Is Sometimes Necessary ‚Äî location: [1663](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1663) ^ref-23508

---
manager is, by definition, a leader who has authority. ‚Äî location: [1670](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1670) ^ref-50581

---
The challenge with collective leadership is that authority is sometimes needed, ‚Äî location: [1686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1686) ^ref-258

---
Authority is needed, but it should be used sparingly. Having authority does not mean that you use ‚Äî location: [1694](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1694) ^ref-11278

---
Authority may be needed to cover many situations, but the best use of authority is often to give others a reasonable degree of autonomy. ‚Äî location: [1696](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1696) ^ref-51052

---
leadership model known as Path-Goal Theory6 posits four leadership styles. Directive Achievement oriented Participative Supportive ‚Äî location: [1718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1718) ^ref-34876

---
An achievement-oriented leader is hands-off but sets objectives for team members. ‚Äî location: [1722](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1722) ^ref-17979

---
leader is collaborative and engages in group decision-making. ‚Äî location: [1723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1723) ^ref-20439

---
supportive leader is more focused on the well-being of the members than on the business objective. ‚Äî location: [1723](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1723) ^ref-38765

---
What about giving up on governance altogether and just letting people self-organize? Let leaders emerge‚Äîwhoever they may be. It seems that a lack of structure actually leads to hidden power structures that are as stifling ‚Äî location: [1741](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1741) ^ref-60994

---
Another problem is that in any self-governed system, leaders emerge; informal authority develops. And so even though there are no appointed leaders, there are still leaders. ‚Äî location: [1764](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1764) ^ref-48678

---
‚ÄúOnce disagreement takes on a life of its own, the chance that resolution will arise simply out of the group dynamic decreases, and a real conflict begins to gain a foothold.‚Äù12 ‚Äî location: [1784](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1784) ^ref-13434

---
Having leaders available to help teams to resolve conflicts is essential.13 ‚Äî location: [1787](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1787) ^ref-5597

---
conflict can lead to team disruption, having external leaders available who can help to stabilize things is ‚Äî location: [1794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1794) ^ref-64997

---
Leadership is influence: a person is a leader if they have influence over others. This includes influence of any kind. ‚Äî location: [1803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1803) ^ref-33595

---
LMX theory observes that ‚Äúin-groups‚Äù or cliques naturally form, and therefore intentional intervention is needed to prevent them or dismantle them. ‚Äî location: [1824](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1824) ^ref-1802

---
There are some specific modes of soft leadership: coaching, mentoring, teaching, coordinating, facilitating, and inspiring or otherwise motivating. ‚Äî location: [1841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1841) ^ref-22259

---
teacher is someone who trains someone in a specific domain of knowledge. Good teachers not only train but operate as a coach as well, and sometimes a mentor, and so effective training often requires all four of the Path-Goal styles of leadership. ‚Äî location: [1846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1846) ^ref-63018

---
Coordinating is a form of leadership in which one takes charge of the dependencies between what many others are doing and tries to optimally reorder them and inject steps to synthesize the various parts. ‚Äî location: [1850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1850) ^ref-20898

---
facilitator is someone who leads a group by coordinating the interactions among the group. Facilitators often lead discussions, during which they make sure that everyone gets a chance to be heard and that the discussion stays on point. ‚Äî location: [1853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1853) ^ref-56191

---
Effective leaders often do manage to facilitate discussions well, even when they inject ideas of their own. ‚Äî location: [1864](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1864) ^ref-60080

---
What matters is how it is done, whether those in the room feel that the leader is open to challenge, and that the best idea will win, no matter who it comes from. ‚Äî location: [1865](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1865) ^ref-39154

---
team of people is a group that is organized for a purpose. ‚Äî location: [1872](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1872) ^ref-39956

---
Besides individual leadership over oneself, a team often needs leadership. For example, it might need coordinating leadership; it might need coaching leadership to help it to grow its abilities; it might need thought leadership about particular domains of knowledge that are mission critical; and it might even need some directive leadership for some issues. ‚Äî location: [1876](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1876) ^ref-35057

---
By an ‚Äúinside person,‚Äù Drucker meant someone who can form relationships of trust with the members of the organization, someone they look up to. ‚Äî location: [1881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1881) ^ref-34403

---
that individual might be a visionary CTO, or it might be a visionary product designer. ‚Äî location: [1883](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1883) ^ref-57267

---
By an ‚Äúoutside person,‚Äù Drucker meant someone to deal with the outside world. ‚Äî location: [1886](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1886) ^ref-55754

---
To do that, one must have some level of authority to be able to make promises, to negotiate deals, and to invest in resources. ‚Äî location: [1888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1888) ^ref-7837

---
The third role described by Drucker was ‚Äúsomeone to get things done.‚Äù That is the organizer. ‚Äî location: [1890](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1890) ^ref-62226

---
An organizer is someone who stays on top of everything, continuously watches for problems, takes action as soon as there is a problem, and orchestrates discussion and timely decision-making. ‚Äî location: [1893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1893) ^ref-53015

---
Socratic leader casts themself as a fellow learner and asks questions and engages in discussion. ‚Äî location: [1899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1899) ^ref-10731

---
Thus, this method must not be used alone for discussing complex issues; those who need to think ‚Äúoffline‚Äù must be allowed to do so and then share their thoughts in a follow-up meeting. ‚Äî location: [1904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1904) ^ref-40923

---
so a Socratic leader must watch for those who stay silent and proactively ask them for their opinion. ‚Äî location: [1907](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08TPJWLHC&location=1907) ^ref-59284
