I was creating my ‚ÄúSecond Brain‚Äù because I could no longer remember things with my first brain (i.e. my actual brain). ‚Äî location: [317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=317) ^ref-45980

those symptoms have a common cause: the volume of information we have to deal with has become inhuman. ‚Äî location: [324](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=324) ^ref-20891

In marketing, tactics are the specific actions and techniques you use to reach your audience and achieve your goals. ‚Äî location: [517](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=517) ^ref-55790

---
**Without a clear direction and understanding of your target audience‚Äôs needs and how you intend to meet them, the most skillful tactics are like paddling aggressively without knowing which way the river flows**. ‚Äî location: [520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=520) ^ref-16804

**==What does my prospect need to believe in order to buy?==** ‚Äî location: [600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=600) ^ref-60104

is the only question you need to ask yourself to develop your core message. ‚Äî location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=602) ^ref-22276

---
We call this entire process Belief Building. ‚Äî location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=603) ^ref-48233

---
**Belief Building is as a sophisticated form of objection handling. If you removed all the prospect‚Äôs objections to buying, they would have no logical choice but to buy from you.** ‚Äî location: [604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=604) ^ref-60801

---
it actively educates prospects on the value and relevance of your offerings. ‚Äî location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=608) ^ref-58275

---
With Belief Building, your role shifts from a seller to an educator and a guide. ‚Äî location: [617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=617) ^ref-18945

Your customers don‚Äôt just make a purchase; they form a lasting relationship with you. ‚Äî location: [622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=622) ^ref-56730

‚ÄúWhat might we be forgetting?‚Äù I ask. In the realm of marketing, we‚Äôve forgotten a crucial element: the art of copywriting. ‚Äî location: [627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=627) ^ref-24212

crafting a compelling argument for why someone should choose your product. ‚Äî location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=629) ^ref-23355

when looking to solve a problem, consider those who faced constraints that led to the best solutions. ‚Äî location: [640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=640) ^ref-56733

---
His book, **Breakthrough Advertising (1966), is considered the Bible of copywriting**. ‚Äî location: [645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=645) ^ref-38254

---
But when it comes to marketing those solutions, your closeness to your topic becomes a drawback. Your prospect isn‚Äôt ready for all those details and distinctions. ‚Äî location: [672](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=672) ^ref-39776

---
If divergence is the problem, convergence is the solution. Convergence is the antidote to complexity and your path back to simplicity. ‚Äî location: [677](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=677) ^ref-45818

---
‚ÄúWhat does my customer need to believe in order to buy?‚Äù Your answer to that question goes into a core messaging document. ‚Äî location: [733](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=733) ^ref-54124

Many said it was the best educational experience of their lives. ‚Äî location: [756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=756) ^ref-44471

I had already done the hard part‚Äîcreating something good‚Äîbut didn‚Äôt know how to capitalize on the opportunity it created for me. ‚Äî location: [767](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=767) ^ref-20863

---
It takes a completely different approach to go beyond that hardcore group and sell to people who‚Äôve never heard of you. ‚Äî location: [779](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=779) ^ref-54681

---
Here are some of the beliefs I came up with when I first did the Belief Building exercise for my online course, **Building a Second Brain: ‚Ä¢ My brain is for having ideas, not holding them. ‚Ä¢ I am already creative and do creative work. ‚Ä¢ My thoughts and ideas are valuable and worth saving and revisiting. ‚Ä¢ I am already doing most of the work required. ‚Ä¢ I can get and stay organized quickly and easily. ‚Ä¢ If I don‚Äôt make an intentional effort to preserve my thinking, it will be lost**. ‚Äî location: [796](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=796) ^ref-17573

---
If any of these beliefs are missing in the minds of my potential customers, there‚Äôs no way they will even consider a course like mine. ‚Äî location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=803) ^ref-44971

---
you are going to create content that may feel very basic. ‚Äî location: [816](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=816) ^ref-13785

---
Rather than think of it as dumbing down, think of it as distilling, refining, boiling it down, finding the essence, or finding the signal in the noise. ‚Äî location: [818](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=818) ^ref-19792

---
diving straight into the full complexity of your topic displays a lack of empathy for your customer. ‚Äî location: [822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=822) ^ref-31923

---
To make it as business owners, we must ask: **‚Ä¢ What stage is my reader at? ‚Ä¢ What‚Äôs their readiness for the next step? ‚Ä¢ What is that next step or milestone? ‚Ä¢ How can I meet them where they are?** ‚Äî location: [826](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=826) ^ref-60780

---
‚ÄúWhat does my customer need to believe to buy?‚Äù gave me the realization that this journey can be understood. ‚Äî location: [838](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=838) ^ref-2599

---
Creating mountains of free content doesn‚Äôt necessarily help the prospect and may actually hurt you. ‚Äî location: [846](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=846) ^ref-10287

---
In addition to missing beliefs, you can also be sabotaged by a false belief. ‚Äî location: [850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=850) ^ref-46668

---
Think of the beliefs driving their behavior: ‚Ä¢ Academic integrity matters. ‚Ä¢ Citing your sources is important. ‚Ä¢ Honesty is an essential part of creating knowledge. ‚Äî location: [859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=859) ^ref-31685

---
A Second Brain helps you better keep track of your sources, so you can cite them accurately ‚Äî location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=866) ^ref-13448

---
When creating any new piece of content, I now ask, ‚ÄúWhich belief is this going to instill or strengthen?‚Äù ‚Äî location: [874](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=874) ^ref-31879

---
Now, armed with my 100+ beliefs, my content has direction. Rather than being random, I know my mission: to instill the beliefs needed for my prospects to buy. ‚Äî location: [880](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=880) ^ref-50321

---
You‚Äôll begin with that **first step: identify where your audience is now.** ‚Äî location: [882](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=882) ^ref-17182

---
Well, the degree of difficulty depends on how deep-seated the belief is. Is the belief lightly held or something deeply ingrained? ‚Äî location: [899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=899) ^ref-13701

---
As much as possible, you want to **speak to people who already have most of the beliefs required to buy from you**. ‚Äî location: [905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=905) ^ref-30330

---
Try this: **==picture the beliefs someone needs to buy from you as a chain. Each belief is linked to (or chained to) another belief.==** ‚Äî location: [911](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=911) ^ref-31417

---
This chain extends from where your prospect is now all the way to your product. We call this chain the chain of beliefs. ‚Äî location: [912](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=912) ^ref-13535

---
I had made an incorrect assumption about what my audience knew. ‚Äî location: [917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=917) ^ref-18245

---
Imagine a prospect trying to read your sales page without even the basic understanding to make sense of it. ‚Äî location: [922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=922) ^ref-47276

---
I recommend stepping into your customers‚Äô shoes and imagining what it‚Äôs like to see the world through the lens of their current knowledge and beliefs. ‚Äî location: [924](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=924) ^ref-17993

Your easiest-to-convert prospects will be those in the inner rings. ‚Äî location: [937](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=937) ^ref-1342

already hold most of the beliefs needed ‚Äî location: [938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=938) ^ref-1135

But then, after that honeymoon phase is over, you find it harder to convert new customers. ‚Äî location: [946](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=946) ^ref-56877

---
To do so, you‚Äôll need to meet those prospects where they are. ‚Äî location: [950](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=950) ^ref-21974

---
you‚Äôll need to communicate with them in a different way. ‚Äî location: [951](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=951) ^ref-34642

---
Prospects with a **==Longer Chain of Beliefs ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt recognize they have a problem. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt know about potential solutions. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt know your topic. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt know you==**. ‚Äî location: [967](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=967) ^ref-44386

Prospect with a Shorter Chain of Beliefs ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt know if your offer is a good value. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt know if now is a good time to buy. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt know if your product will be easy to use. ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt know if they should trust you. ‚Äî location: [972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=972) ^ref-62777

warm prospects respond best to messaging that focuses on price, the guarantee, and the trustworthiness of the company. ‚Äî location: [979](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=979) ^ref-41573

That‚Äôs a key point to highlight: give your prospects better questions to ask. ‚Äî location: [1049](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=1049) ^ref-56196

**Price of the product. The lower the price, the less Belief Building you‚Äôll need to do. ‚Ä¢ Length of the sales cycle. It takes less time to sell a gallon of milk to a family than accounting software to the government. ‚Ä¢ Complexity of the product. A coaching program is more complicated to use than eggs. ‚Ä¢ How novel the product is. Henry Ford had to educate horse and buggy owners on his revolutionary Model T car. It took a lot of Belief Building, but it was worth it.** ‚Äî location: [1916](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0CW1MQZXP&location=1916) ^ref-34824
