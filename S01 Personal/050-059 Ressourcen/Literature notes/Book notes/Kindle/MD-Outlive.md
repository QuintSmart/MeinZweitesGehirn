## Highlights
There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why they‚Äôre falling in. ‚Äî location: [430](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=430) ^ref-52520

Longevity has two components. The first is how long you live, your chronological lifespan, but the second and equally important part is how well you live‚Äîthe quality of your years. This is called healthspan, ‚Äî location: [487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=487) ^ref-56001

Medicine‚Äôs biggest failing is in attempting to treat all these conditions at the wrong end of the timescale‚Äîafter they are entrenched‚Äîrather than before they take root. ‚Äî location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=584) ^ref-16537

fat, but protein becomes critically important as we age. ‚Äî location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=602) ^ref-48318

---
Exercise is by far the most potent longevity ‚Äúdrug.‚Äù No other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function. But most people don‚Äôt do nearly enough‚Äîand exercising the wrong way can do as much harm as good. ‚Äî location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=602) ^ref-59117

---
striving for physical health and longevity is meaningless if we ignore our emotional health. Emotional suffering can decimate our health on all fronts, and it must be addressed. ‚Äî location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=605) ^ref-53710

Risk is not something to be avoided at all costs; rather, it‚Äôs something we need to understand, analyze, and work with. ‚Äî location: [713](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=713) ^ref-5093

experimenting. Instead of using treatments that they believed might work, often despite ample anecdotal evidence to the contrary, scientists and physicians could systematically test and evaluate potential cures, then choose the ones that had performed best in experiments. ‚Äî location: [751](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=751) ^ref-12982

Medicine 2.0 tries to figure out how to get dry after it starts raining. Medicine 3.0 studies meteorology and tries to determine whether we need to build a better roof, or a boat. ‚Äî location: [820](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=820) ^ref-53017

First, it forces people to focus on their own endgame, which most of us might prefer to avoid thinking about. ‚Äî location: [927](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=927) ^ref-25303

To achieve our objectives, we first need to have a strategy: an overall approach, a conceptual scaffolding or mental model that is informed by science, is tailored to our goals, and gives us options. ‚Äî location: [973](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=973) ^ref-12965

---
The point is that the tactics are what you do when you are actually in the ring. The strategy is the harder part, because it requires careful study of one‚Äôs opponent, identifying his strengths and weaknesses, and figuring out how to use both to your advantage, well before actually stepping in the ring. In this book, we will apply this three-part approach to longevity: objective ‚Üí strategy ‚Üí tactics. ‚Äî location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=993) ^ref-29621

Horsemen. The Horsemen do have one powerful risk factor in common, and that is age. As you grow older, the risk grows exponentially that one or more of these diseases has begun to take hold in your body. ‚Äî location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1005) ^ref-12756

The only way to become an adroit tactician is to shift your mindset to Medicine 3.0, which requires becoming a master strategist first. ‚Äî location: [1023](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1023) ^ref-51303

Our tactics in Medicine 3.0 fall into five broad domains: exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and exogenous molecules, meaning drugs, hormones, or supplements. ‚Äî location: [1080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1080) ^ref-1274

exercise not only delays actual death but also prevents both cognitive and physical decline, better than any other intervention. ‚Äî location: [1093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1093) ^ref-15681

evidence. The best science out there says that what you eat matters, but the first-order term is how much you eat: how many calories you take into your body. ‚Äî location: [1098](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1098) ^ref-20580

Good sleep is critical to our innate physiological repair processes, especially in the brain, while poor sleep triggers a cascade of negative downstream consequences, from insulin resistance to cognitive decline, as well as mental health issues. ‚Äî location: [1107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1107) ^ref-40101

Studies of Scandinavian twins6 have found that genes may be responsible for only about 20 to 30 percent of the overall variation in human lifespan. ‚Äî location: [1256](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1256) ^ref-57761

The e2 variant of APOE, on the other hand, seems to protect its carriers against dementia‚Äîand it also turns out to be very highly associated with longevity. ‚Äî location: [1365](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1365) ^ref-9719

three SNPs (or variants) in FOXO314 that were strongly associated with healthy aging and longevity. ‚Äî location: [1389](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1389) ^ref-25982

---
When FOXO3 is activated, it in turn activates genes that generally keep our cells healthier. ‚Äî location: [1399](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1399) ^ref-13048

---
FOXO3 can be activated or suppressed by our own behaviors. ‚Äî location: [1401](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1401) ^ref-17783

---
when we are slightly deprived of nutrients, or when we are exercising, FOXO3 tends to be more activated, ‚Äî location: [1402](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1402) ^ref-27915

older people who were put on a regular exercise program shifted to a more youthful pattern of gene expression after six months. ‚Äî location: [1411](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1411) ^ref-2705

Some types of exercise reduce risk for all chronic diseases, while others help maintain the physical and cognitive resilience that centenarians largely get via their genes. ‚Äî location: [1440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1440) ^ref-27494

which is that it tends to slow down the process of cellular growth and division. ‚Äî location: [1504](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1504) ^ref-18594

---
When food is plentiful, mTOR is activated and the cell (or the organism) goes into growth mode, producing new proteins and undergoing cell division, as with the ultimate goal of reproduction. ‚Äî location: [1519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1519) ^ref-39522

---
When nutrients are scarce, mTOR is suppressed and cells go into a kind of ‚Äúrecycling‚Äù mode, breaking down cellular components and generally cleaning house. ‚Äî location: [1520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1520) ^ref-55001

---
Reducing the amount of nutrients available to a cell seems to trigger a group of innate pathways that enhance the cell‚Äôs stress resistance and metabolic efficiency‚Äîall of them related, in some way, to mTOR. ‚Äî location: [1598](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1598) ^ref-49499

---
Restricting the amount of nutrients that are available, via dietary restriction or exercise, triggers the production of newer, more efficient mitochondria to replace old and damaged ones. ‚Äî location: [1607](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1607) ^ref-37910

---
These fresh mitochondria help the cell produce more ATP, the cellular energy currency, with the fuel it does have. ‚Äî location: [1608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1608) ^ref-34036

Specifically, it seems to be a drop in amino acids that induces mTOR to shut down, ‚Äî location: [1611](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1611) ^ref-6067

---
cleanup is carried out by specialized organelles called lysosomes, which package up the old proteins and other detritus, including pathogens, and grind them down (via enzymes) for reuse. In addition, the lysosomes also break up and destroy things called aggregates, which are clumps of damaged proteins that accumulate over time. ‚Äî location: [1621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1621) ^ref-35528

But as we get older, autophagy declines. ‚Äî location: [1629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1629) ^ref-51858

Thus, I find it fascinating that this very important cellular mechanism can be triggered by certain kinds of interventions, such as a temporary reduction in nutrients (as when we are exercising or fasting)‚Äî ‚Äî location: [1630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1630) ^ref-39717

If you can somehow remove the fat from the liver (most commonly via weight loss), the inflammation will resolve, and liver function returns to normal. ‚Äî location: [1778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1778) ^ref-56699

The upshot is that it‚Äôs not only obesity that drives bad health outcomes; it‚Äôs metabolic dysfunction. ‚Äî location: [1834](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1834) ^ref-12603

An adult male can typically store a total of about 1,600 calories worth of glycogen between these two sites, or about enough energy for two hours of vigorous endurance exercise. ‚Äî location: [1841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1841) ^ref-36826

One of the liver‚Äôs many important jobs is to convert this stored glycogen back to glucose and then to release it as needed to maintain blood glucose levels at a steady state, known as glucose homeostasis. ‚Äî location: [1844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1844) ^ref-48374

more calories flood into your subcutaneous fat tissue, it eventually reaches capacity and the surplus begins spilling over into other areas of your body: into your blood, as excess triglycerides; into your liver, contributing to NAFLD; into your muscle tissue, contributing directly to insulin resistance in the muscle (as we‚Äôll see); and even around your heart and your pancreas ‚Äî location: [1875](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=1875) ^ref-18526

It is very difficult to get fat from eating too many apples, for example, because the fructose in the apple enters our system relatively slowly, mixed with fiber and water, and our gut and our metabolism can handle it normally. ‚Äî location: [2005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=2005) ^ref-50529

---
I test my patients‚Äô levels of uric acid, not only because high levels may promote fat storage but also because it is linked to high blood pressure. ‚Äî location: [2009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=2009) ^ref-26760

Instead, energy (ATP) levels inside the cell drop rapidly and dramatically. This rapid drop in energy levels makes the cell think that we are still hungry. ‚Äî location: [2018](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=2018) ^ref-17831

fructose basically tricks our metabolism into thinking that we are depleting energy‚Äîand need to take in still more food and store more energy as fat. ‚Äî location: [2019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=2019) ^ref-24333

consuming large quantities of liquid fructose simply overwhelms the ability of the gut to handle it; the excess is shunted to the liver, where many of those calories are likely to end up as fat. ‚Äî location: [2022](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0BLBYCBQ9&location=2022) ^ref-4999
