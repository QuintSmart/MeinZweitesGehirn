If there is any sure route to success and fulfillment in life, it is to be found in the long-term, essentially goalless process of mastery. ‚Äî location: [90](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=90) ^ref-10469

You started with something difficult and made it easy and pleasurable through instruction and practice. ‚Äî location: [124](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=124) ^ref-5898

It‚Äôs available to anyone who is willing to get on the path and stay on it‚Äî ‚Äî location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=132) ^ref-29193

whenever you decide to learn any new skill‚Äî ‚Äî location: [139](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=139) ^ref-59308

If you‚Äôre going to go for mastery, it‚Äôs better to start with a clean slate rather than have to unlearn bad habits you picked up while hacking around. ‚Äî location: [146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=146) ^ref-52893

the plateau can be a form of purgatory. It triggers disowned emotions. It flushes out hidden motivations. ‚Äî location: [166](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=166) ^ref-49173

Sometimes we choose after careful deliberation, but frequently the choice is careless‚Äîa barely conscious ‚Äî location: [195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=195) ^ref-20782

When you start to learn a new skill, however, you do have to think about it, and you have to make an effort to replace old patterns of sensing, movement, and cognition with new. ‚Äî location: [239](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=239) ^ref-21221

the cognitive and effort systems ‚Äúclick into‚Äù the habitual system and reprogram ‚Äî location: [243](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=243) ^ref-52554

But learning to love the plateau is getting ahead of our story. ‚Äî location: [251](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=251) ^ref-2611

But recognition is often unsatisfying and fame is like sea-water for the thirsty. ‚Äî location: [495](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=495) ^ref-48969

Love of your work, willingness to stay with it even in the absence of extrinsic reward, is good food and good drink. ‚Äî location: [496](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=496) ^ref-37444

Goals and contingencies, as I‚Äôve said, are important. But they exist in the future and the past, beyond the pale of the sensory realm. ‚Äî location: [510](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=510) ^ref-49693

Key 1: Instruction ‚Äî location: [533](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=533) ^ref-41660

It‚Äôs particularly challenging, in fact, for a top performer to become a first-rate teacher. ‚Äî location: [549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=549) ^ref-45305

Knowledge, expertise, technical skill, and credentials are important, but without the patience and empathy that go with teaching beginners, these merits are as nothing. ‚Äî location: [568](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=568) ^ref-23913

strangely enough, those with exceptional talent have trouble staying on the path of mastery. ‚Äî location: [642](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=642) ^ref-4547

When you learn too easily, you‚Äôre tempted not to work hard, ‚Äî location: [653](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=653) ^ref-4705

In most cases, audio and video tapes have only limited effectiveness. Learning eventually involves interaction between the learner and the learning environment, and its effectiveness relates to the frequency, quality, variety, and intensity of the interaction. ‚Äî location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=666) ^ref-22975

But it‚Äôs also true that one good paragraph sometimes has more power to change the individual and the world than any number of pictures. ‚Äî location: [674](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=674) ^ref-41625

Key 3: Surrender ‚Äî location: [776](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=776) ^ref-49109

This means surrendering to your teacher and to the demands of your discipline. ‚Äî location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=778) ^ref-2104

surrendering your own hard-won proficiency from time to time in order to reach a higher or different level of proficiency. ‚Äî location: [778](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=778) ^ref-31607

‚ÄúMore and more, the universe looks like a great thought rather than a great machine,‚Äù says astronomer Sir James Jeans. ‚Äî location: [913](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=913) ^ref-24467

---
It‚Äôs also involved in the transformation of that structure from one of its forms to another. This sort of transformation, in fact, is what the process of mastery is all about. ‚Äî location: [923](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=923) ^ref-55118

---
‚ÄúAll I know,‚Äù said Arnold Schwarzenneger, ‚Äúis that the first step is to create the vision, because when you see the vision there‚Äîthe beautiful vision‚Äîthat creates the ‚Äòwant power.‚Äô ‚Äî location: [929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=929) ^ref-27632

heroic desire to use herself to the limit, to finish at all cost, to attain the unattainable. ‚Äî location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=978) ^ref-31425

---
resistance to change, is called homeostasis. ‚Äî location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=998) ^ref-5236

---
The problem is, homeostasis works to keep things as they are even if they aren‚Äôt very good. ‚Äî location: [1020](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1020) ^ref-17926

---
Just let it be said that the resistance here (as in other cases) is proportionate to the size and speed of the change, ‚Äî location: [1040](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1040) ^ref-59499

---
You might experience homeostatic alarm signals in the form of physical or psychological symptoms. You might unknowingly sabotage your own best efforts. ‚Äî location: [1053](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1053) ^ref-2712

---
1. Be aware of the way homeostasis works. ‚Äî location: [1059](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1059) ^ref-34974

don‚Äôt panic and give up at the first sign of trouble. ‚Äî location: [1063](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1063) ^ref-33217

Bear in mind that an entire system has to change when any part of it changes. ‚Äî location: [1067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1067) ^ref-55215

---
Be willing to negotiate with your resistance to change. ‚Äî location: [1070](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1070) ^ref-45223

---
The fine art of playing the edge in this case involves a willingness to take one step back for every two forward, sometimes vice versa. ‚Äî location: [1075](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1075) ^ref-17531

---
Develop a support system. ‚Äî location: [1080](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1080) ^ref-11433

---
it helps a great deal to have other people with whom you can share the joys and perils of the change you‚Äôre making. ‚Äî location: [1081](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1081) ^ref-57933

---
Follow a regular practice. People embarking on any type of change can gain stability and comfort through practicing some worthwhile activity on a more or less regular basis, ‚Äî location: [1091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1091) ^ref-47477

Dedicate yourself to lifelong learning. We tend to forget that learning is much more than book learning. ‚Äî location: [1097](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1097) ^ref-13957

---
To learn is to change. Education, whether it involves books, body, or behavior, is a process that changes ‚Äî location: [1098](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1098) ^ref-46343

---
and the best learning of all involves learning how to learn‚Äîthat is, to change. ‚Äî location: [1099](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1099) ^ref-33901

but for the most part we gain energy by using energy. ‚Äî location: [1112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1112) ^ref-9054

learning is dull. There‚Äôs only one right answer to every question, and you‚Äôd better learn that answer by sitting still and listening passively, not doing anything. ‚Äî location: [1127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ND0X91Y&location=1127) ^ref-800
