---
Benefit. The conditions created by Power must materially augment cash flow, and this is the magnitude aspect of our dual attributes. It can manifest as any combination of increased prices, reduced costs and/or lessened investment needs. ‚Äî location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=301) ^ref-59276

---
There must be some aspect of the Power conditions which prevents existing and potential competitors, both direct and functional, from engaging in the sort of value-destroying arbitrage ‚Äî location: [304](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=304) ^ref-8801

In the case of Intel, memories and microprocessors were essentially separate businesses, posing two unique orthogonal Strategy problems. ‚Äî location: [320](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=320) ^ref-782

To get these crux moves right, you must flexibly adapt your strategy to emerging circumstances. ‚Äî location: [333](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=333) ^ref-31993

Netflix paid $100M for House of Cards and their streaming business had 30M customers, then the cost per customer was three dollars and change. In this scenario, a competitor with only one million subscribers would have to ante up $100 per subscriber. ‚Äî location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=388) ^ref-21567

Scale Economies‚Äîthe First of the 7 Powers ‚Äî location: [392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=392) ^ref-55270

---
The quality of declining unit costs with increased business size is referred to as Scale Economies. ‚Äî location: [392](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=392) ^ref-56360

---
For Scale Economies, the Benefit is straightforward: lowered costs. ‚Äî location: [400](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=400) ^ref-57137

---
Scale Economies: Benefit: Reduced Cost Barrier: Prohibitive Costs of Share Gains ‚Äî location: [415](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=415) ^ref-16121

---
Volume/area relationships. ‚Äî location: [436](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=436) ^ref-15677

---
Bulk milk tanks and warehouses would serve as examples. ‚Äî location: [437](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=437) ^ref-2234

---
Distribution network density. As the density of a distribution network increases to accommodate more customers per area, delivery costs decline as more economical route structures can be accommodated. ‚Äî location: [438](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=438) ^ref-35033

---
Learning economies. If learning leads to a benefit (reduced cost or improved deliverables) ‚Äî location: [440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=440) ^ref-30281

---
Purchasing economies. A larger scale buyer can often elicit better pricing for inputs. ‚Äî location: [441](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=441) ^ref-1059

---
In our discussion of Power, I have been careful to characterize it as creating a potential for value, but this potential can only be realized when coupled with operational excellence. ‚Äî location: [449](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=449) ^ref-65214

---
Surplus Leader Margin (SLM). This is the profit margin the business with Power can expect to achieve if pricing is such that its competitor‚Äôs profits are zero. ‚Äî location: [463](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=463) ^ref-65388

---
Netflix‚Äôs success could only emerge once they had crafted a route to continuing Power in significant markets‚Äîin other words, a strategy. ‚Äî location: [486](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=486) ^ref-57937

---
Such one-hand-shakes-the-other self-reinforcing upward spirals are known as Network Economies ‚Äî location: [518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=518) ^ref-22892

---
the value of the service to each customer is enhanced as new customers join the ‚Äúnetwork.‚Äù ‚Äî location: [519](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=519) ^ref-19594

---
In such a situation, having the most customers is everything, and Marini knew exactly how this game was played: rapidly scale or die. ‚Äî location: [520](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=520) ^ref-26590

---
Users wanted this wall maintained, a lesson Facebook themselves learned in their failed rollout of Facebook at Work. ‚Äî location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=542) ^ref-20022

---
Network Economies occur when the value of a product to a customer is increased by the use of the product by others. ‚Äî location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=546) ^ref-36951

---
The barrier for Network Economies is the unattractive cost/benefit of gaining share, ‚Äî location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=550) ^ref-24487

---
‚ÄúWhat would BranchOut have had to offer users for them to use BranchOut rather than LinkedIn?‚Äù ‚Äî location: [551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=551) ^ref-24905

---
Winner take all. Businesses with strong Network Economies are frequently characterized by a tipping point: once a single firm achieves a certain degree of leadership, then the other firms just throw in the towel. ‚Äî location: [554](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=554) ^ref-4578

---
The boundaries of the network effects determine the boundaries of the business. ‚Äî location: [559](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=559) ^ref-9156

---
Decisive early product. Due to tipping point dynamics, early relative scaling is critical in developing Power. Who scales the fastest is often determined by who gets the product most right early on. ‚Äî location: [560](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=560) ^ref-64687

---
If a business has important complements and these complements are somehow exclusive to each offering, then a leader will attract more and/or better complements. ‚Äî location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=629) ^ref-4326

We are a complement to go1

---
An example of this would be smartphone apps. Another smartphone OS would be hard to offer at this point because ‚Äî location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=631) ^ref-39439

---
In situations like this, it falls to the strategist to carefully peel back the layers of complexity and eventually seize upon some irreduceable kernel of insight amidst the competitive reality. ‚Äî location: [679](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=679) ^ref-51622

---
An upstart who developed a superior, heterodox business model. That business model‚Äôs ability to successfully challenge well-entrenched and formidable incumbents. The steady accumulation of customers, all while the incumbent remains seemingly paralyzed and unable to respond. ‚Äî location: [682](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=682) ^ref-22628

---
But nearly always, these featured the same outcome: the incumbent responds either not at all or too late. ‚Äî location: [686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=686) ^ref-29370

---
The new business model is superior to the incumbent‚Äôs model due to lower costs and/or the ability to charge higher prices. ‚Äî location: [689](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=689) ^ref-61907

Sounds like Blue Ocean?

---
The incumbent‚Äôs failure to respond, more often than not, results from thoughtful calculation. They observe the upstart‚Äôs new model, and ask, ‚ÄúAm I better off staying the course, or adopting the new model?‚Äù ‚Äî location: [698](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=698) ^ref-64279

---
A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business. ‚Äî location: [706](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=706) ^ref-29466

---
More generally this situation can be characterized by three conditions: A new superior approach is developed (lower costs and/or improved features). ‚Äî location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=728) ^ref-51040

---
The products from the new approach exhibit a high degree of substitutability for the products from the old approach. ‚Äî location: [730](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=730) ^ref-28013

---
The incumbent has little prospect for Power in this new business: ‚Äî location: [731](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=731) ^ref-56971

---
rather it indicated only that digital photography as a stand-alone business failed to offer even the faintest promise of Power for Kodak. ‚Äî location: [737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=737) ^ref-43262

---
The term I use is ‚ÄúMilk‚Äù because the CEO is essentially choosing to milk a declining original business even though the new model is attractive. ‚Äî location: [756](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=756) ^ref-35609

---
The challenger‚Äôs approach is novel and, at first, unproven. As a consquence, it is shrouded in uncertainty, especially to those looking in from the outside. The low signal-to-noise of the situation only heightens that uncertainty. ‚Äî location: [772](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=772) ^ref-17619

---
The incumbent has a successful business model. This heritage is influential and deeply embedded, as suggested by Nelson and Winter‚Äôs30 notion of ‚Äúroutines,‚Äù and with it comes a certain view of how the world works. The CEO probably can‚Äôt help but view circumstances through this lens, at least in part. ‚Äî location: [774](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=774) ^ref-43528

---
to at first belittle the new approach, grossly underestimating its potential. ‚Äî location: [777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=777) ^ref-30283

---
Agency and Cognitive Bias issues are not mutually exclusive; frequently they appear in concert, ‚Äî location: [791](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=791) ^ref-11772

---
the relationship of Counter-Positioning to the well-known concept of Disruptive Technologies, ‚Äî location: [793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=793) ^ref-63709

---
At the heart of Counter-Positioning lies the development of a new business model that, over time, has the potential to supplant the old. ‚Äî location: [798](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=798) ^ref-64040

---
there is a many-to-many mapping of all Power Types to Disruptive Technologies. ‚Äî location: [804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=804) ^ref-51001

---
Because Disruptive Technologies tell us nothing about Power they do not inform us about value.31 Because of this, the subject is only a sidebar in the Statics of Strategy. ‚Äî location: [804](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=804) ^ref-10241

---
this type of Power only applies relative to the incumbent and says nothing regarding Power relative to other firms utilizing the new business model. ‚Äî location: [812](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=812) ^ref-25065

---
In its ascendancy, the challenger should avoid the temptation of trumpeting its superiority, instead suppressing that urge and adopting a tone of respect toward the incumbent. ‚Äî location: [817](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=817) ^ref-7161

---
two prior chapters covered Power types that were exclusive: ‚Äî location: [819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=819) ^ref-48310

---
In contrast, there could be‚Äîand often are, in fact‚Äîmany challengers Counter-Positioned respective to the incumbent. ‚Äî location: [821](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=821) ^ref-61538

---
the incumbent puts a toe in the water, somehow, but refuses to commit in a way that meaningfully answers the challenge. ‚Äî location: [836](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=836) ^ref-17609

the Barrier arises from the unattractive cost/benefit of share gains for the challenger. ‚Äî location: [986](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=986) ^ref-18664

The value loss expected by a customer that would be incurred from switching to an alternate supplier for additional purchases. ‚Äî location: [990](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=990) ^ref-61555

Financial. Financial Switching Costs include those which are transparently monetary from the outset. ‚Äî location: [994](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=994) ^ref-52281

---
Procedural. Procedural Switching Costs are somewhat murkier but no less persuasive. They stem from the loss of familiarity with the product or from the the risk and uncertainty associated with the adoption of a new product. ‚Äî location: [996](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=996) ^ref-43692

there can be a significant cost to retraining them in a different system. ‚Äî location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=998) ^ref-45274

---
Relational. Relational Switching Costs are those tolls which would result from the breaking of emotional bonds built up through use of the product and through interactions ‚Äî location: [1004](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1004) ^ref-18658

or if they enjoy the camaraderie which exists amongst a community of like users, they may shrink from the prospect of switching identities and abandoning that community. ‚Äî location: [1008](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1008) ^ref-30043

---
Switching Costs are a non-exclusive Power type: all players can enjoy their benefits. ‚Äî location: [1011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1011) ^ref-49879

---
More often than not this leads to enhanced competition to grab new customers, which arbitrages out the Benefit for new customer acquisitions. ‚Äî location: [1013](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1013) ^ref-15352

---
Switching Costs offer no Benefit if no additional related sales are made to the customer. ‚Äî location: [1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1016) ^ref-36601

---
To assure that such additional sales take place, one tactic might be to develop more and more add-on products. ‚Äî location: [1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1016) ^ref-34851

Branding is an asset that communicates information and evokes positive emotions in the customer, leading to an increased willingness to pay for the product. ‚Äî location: [1101](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1101) ^ref-10663

---
A business with Branding is able to charge a higher price ‚Äî location: [1103](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1103) ^ref-56010

---
Affective valence. The built-up associations with the brand elicit good feelings about the offering, distinct from the objective value of the good. For example, Safeway‚Äôs cola may be indistinguishable from Coke‚Äôs in a blind taste test, but even after revealing the result, the taste tester remains willing to pay more for Coke. ‚Äî location: [1104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1104) ^ref-36538

---
Uncertainty reduction. A customer attains ‚Äúpeace of mind‚Äù knowing that the branded product will be as just as expected. ‚Äî location: [1107](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1107) ^ref-37772

---
Barrier. A strong brand can only be created over a lengthy period of reinforcing actions (hysteresis), which itself serves as the key Barrier. ‚Äî location: [1112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1112) ^ref-40461

---
What‚Äôs more, copycats face daunting uncertainty in initiating Branding: a long investment runway with no assurance of an eventual path to significant affective valence. Efforts to mimic another brand run the risk of trademark infringement actions as well with their attendant costs and unclear outcomes. ‚Äî location: [1113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MRLFFQ7&location=1113) ^ref-27267

In other instances, however, the Cornered Resource can emerge in varied forms, offering uniquely different benefits.
