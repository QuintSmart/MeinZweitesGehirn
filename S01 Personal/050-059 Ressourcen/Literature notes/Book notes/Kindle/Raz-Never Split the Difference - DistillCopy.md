They seemed to insinuate that the other side was being dishonest and unfair. And that was enough to make them falter and negotiate with themselves. — location: [300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=300) ^ref-53333

---
“I’m just asking questions,” I said. “It’s a passive-aggressive approach. I just ask the same three or four open-ended questions over and over and over and over. They get worn out answering and give me everything I want.” — location: [303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=303) ^ref-45710

As you just saw, the beauty of going right after negativity is that it brings us to a safe zone of empathy. — location: [1198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=1198) ^ref-64973

==how we dress up our negotiations in mathematical theories, we are always an animal, always acting and reacting first and foremost from our deeply held but mostly invisible and inchoate fears, needs, perceptions, and desires==. — location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=312) ^ref-15327

One, separate the person—the emotion—from the problem; two, don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions. — location: [357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=357) ^ref-21080

There’s the ==Framing Effect, which demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed== — location: [374](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=374) ^ref-28420

---
==Prospect Theory explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses==. — location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=376) ^ref-37611

which shows how ==people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain==. — location: [377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=377) ^ref-16376

---
==System 1’s inchoate beliefs, feelings, and impressions are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2==. — location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=381) ^ref-3104

---
==We react emotionally (System 1) to a suggestion or question. Then that System 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the System 2 answer.== — location: [382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=382) ^ref-33953

---
if you know how to ==affect your counterpart’s System 1 thinking==, his inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your questions and statements, then you can guide his System 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses. — location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=384) ^ref-58730

---

conducting negotiations based on System 2 concepts without the tools to read, understand, and manipulate the System 1 emotional underpinning was like trying to make an omelet without first knowing how to crack an egg. — location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=388) ^ref-61901

simple psychological tactics and strategies that worked in the field to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs, and persuade the other guy of our empathy. — location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=419) ^ref-37753

---
These counseling skills were aimed at developing positive relationships with people by demonstrating an understanding of what they’re going through and how they feel about it. — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=425) ^ref-3065

---
starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. — location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=427) ^ref-23452

---
Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing. — location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=427) ^ref-45815

---
when individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings. — location: [429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=429) ^ref-49042

Tactical Empathy. This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person. — location: [433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=433) ^ref-29961

---
---
==The majority of the interactions== we have at work and at home are negotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalistic urge: ==I want.== — location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=442) ^ref-19103

---
==want you to accept that $1 million contract.” “I want to pay $20,000 for that car.” “I want you to give me a 10 percent raise.”== — location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=445) ^ref-52734

---
Negotiation is the heart of collaboration. It is what makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties. It can change your life, as it has changed mine. — location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=516) ^ref-46148

---
---
==great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises== they are certain exist. — location: [547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=547) ^ref-18558

---
Experience will have taught them that they are ==best served by holding multiple hypotheses—about the situation, about the counterpart’s wants, about a whole array of variables==—in their mind at the same time. — location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=548) ^ref-20716

---
they use all the new information that comes their way to test and winnow true hypotheses from false ones. — location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=550) ^ref-15923

---
---
You should ==engage the process with a mindset of discovery.== — location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=552) ^ref-7604

---

really smart people often have trouble being negotiators—they’re so smart they think they don’t have anything to discover. — location: [553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=553) ^ref-9020

---
---
==Great negotiators are able to question the assumptions== that the rest of the involved players accept on faith or in arrogance, and thus ==remain more emotionally open to all possibilities, and more intellectually agile to a fluid situation==. — location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=557) ^ref-37261

---
==be aware of a counterpart’s overuse of personal pronouns—we/they or me/I. The less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is== (and vice versa). — location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=563) ^ref-57506

The thinking behind this policy was that all these extra sets of ears would pick up extra information. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=584) ^ref-14580

---
tell them, should be a wake-up call. It’s really not that easy to listen well. — location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=590) ^ref-57983

---
We are easily distracted. We engage in selective listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our minds acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. — location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=591) ^ref-33048

---
Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively. — location: [592](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=592) ^ref-24453

---
George A. Miller persuasively put forth the idea that we can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment. In other words, we are easily overwhelmed. — location: [595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=595) ^ref-43870

---
---
==When they’re not talking, they’re thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking, they’re making their arguments==. — location: [597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=597) ^ref-19753

*So true listening needs focus on the listening and hearing in several dimensions.*

everyone just listening to the voice in their head (and not well, because they’re doing seven or eight other things at the same time). — location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=599) ^ref-15702

---
make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. — location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=602) ^ref-11100

---
In that mode of true active listening—aided by the tactics you’ll learn in the following chapters—you’ll disarm your counterpart. You’ll make them feel safe. The voice in their head will begin to quiet down. — location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=603) ^ref-28865

---
The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want. — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=605) ^ref-4967

---
The latter will help you discover the former. — location: [606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=606) ^ref-54484

---
But neither wants nor needs are where we start; it begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=608) ^ref-36018

---
The problem was, we were in too much of a hurry, driving too hard toward a quick solution; trying to be a problem solver, not a people mover. — location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=629) ^ref-49621

---
make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. — location: [889](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=889) ^ref-11100

---
==Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making==. If — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=631) ^ref-38432

---
we’re ==too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard== and we risk undermining the rapport and trust we’ve built. There’s plenty of research that now validates the passage of time as one of the most important tools for a negotiator. — location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=631) ^ref-25614

---
==When you slow the process down, you also calm it down.== After all, if someone is talking, they’re not shooting. — location: [633](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=633) ^ref-26001

---
switched into my ==Late-Night, FM DJ Voice: deep, soft, slow, and reassuring==. — location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=650) ^ref-10950

When deliberating on a negotiating strategy or approach, people tend to focus all their energies on what to say or do, but it’s how we are (our general demeanor and delivery) that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most immediately effective mode of influence. — location: [657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=657) ^ref-31372

---

---
That’s why ==your most powerful tool in any verbal communication is your voice==. — location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=665) ^ref-56537
You can use your voice to intentionally reach into someone’s brain and flip an emotional switch. — location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=666) ^ref-49045

---

---
There are essentially ==three voice tones== available to negotiators: ==the late-night FM DJ voice==, ==the positive/playful voice==, and t==he direct or assertive voice==. — location: [668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=668) ^ref-37591

---
==Most of the time==, you should be using the ==positive/playful voice.== It’s the ==voice of an easygoing, good-natured person==. — location: [671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=671) ^ref-35043

---
==A smile, even while talking on the phone, has an impact== tonally that the other person will pick up on. — location: [673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=673) ^ref-1990

---
When people are in a ==positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve== (instead of fight and resist). — location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=680) ^ref-24710

---
It applies to the smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: ==a smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility==. — location: [681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=681) ^ref-49892

---
==when you inflect your voice in a downward way, you put it out there that you’ve got it covered. Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: I’m in control.== — location: [683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=683) ^ref-29823

When you inflect in an upward way, you invite a response. Why? Because you’ve brought in a measure of uncertainty. You’ve made a statement sound like a question. You’ve left the door open for the other guy to take the lead, — location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=684) ^ref-52302

---
It’s the same voice I might use in a contract negotiation, when an item isn’t up for discussion. — location: [686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=686) ^ref-23623

---

---
==Mirroring==, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which ==we copy each other to comfort each other==. — location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=710) ^ref-11279

---
It can be done ==with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice.== — location: [711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=711) ^ref-6658
profound biological principle: We fear what’s different and are drawn to what’s similar. — location: [715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=715) ^ref-13860

---

---
“Trust me,” a mirror signals to another’s unconscious, “==You and I—we’re alike.”== — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=716) ^ref-39335

---
a “mirror” is when you ==repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words)== of what someone has just said. — location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=721) ^ref-31497
your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said and sustain the process of connecting. — location: [724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=724) ^ref-3347

---

---
The other group of ==waiters mirrored their customers simply by repeating their orders back== to them. — location: [727](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=727) ^ref-58881

the average tip of the waiters who mirrored was 70 percent more than of those who used positive reinforcement. — location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=728) ^ref-5538

---

---
==For a mirror to be effective, you’ve got to let it sit there and do its work==. — location: [732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=732) ^ref-1816

The ability to get inside the head—and eventually under the skin—of your counterpart depends on these techniques and a willingness to change your approach, based on new evidence, along the way. — location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=831) ^ref-60367

---

---
It’s just four simple steps:         ==1.      Use the late-night FM DJ voice.         2.      Start with “I’m sorry . . .”         3.      Mirror.         4.      Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.         5.      Repeat==. One — location: [841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=841) ^ref-27034

“I’m sorry, two copies?” she mirrored in response, — location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=854) ^ref-1890

---

---
The ==intention behind most mirrors should be “Please, help me understand.”== Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said. — location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=855) ^ref-59923
“Yes,” her boss responded, “one for us and one for the customer.” “I’m sorry, so you are saying that the client is asking for a copy and we need a copy for internal use?” — location: [859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=859) ^ref-34098

---
the technique takes a little practice. Once you get the hang of it, though, it’ll become a conversational Swiss Army knife valuable — location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=871) ^ref-22209

---

---
The ==language of negotiation is primarily a language of conversation and rapport==: a way of quickly establishing relationships and getting people to talk and think together. — location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=873) ^ref-49215
you’ll see a refined set of powerful skills: a conscious smile to ease the tension, use of subtle verbal and nonverbal language to signal empathy (and thus security), a certain downward inflection in the voice, embrace of specific kinds of questions and avoidance of others—a whole array of previously hidden skills that will prove invaluable to you, once you’ve learned to use them. — location: [879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=879) ^ref-56630

---
a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find. — location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=884) ^ref-3266

---
==Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously.== — location: [885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=885) ^ref-18725

---
Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to ==uncover as much information as possible==. — location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=888) ^ref-65251

Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. — location: [891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=891) ^ref-38777

==people can feel as if they’re not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport and trust you’ve built.== — location: [892](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=892) ^ref-8264


Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve — location: [893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=893) ^ref-38598

---
---
==The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow.== When done properly, you create an ==aura of authority and trustworthiness== without triggering defensiveness. — location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=897) ^ref-13913

---
The ==positive/playful voice==: Should be your default voice. ==It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile while you’re talking==. — location: [899](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=899) ^ref-50787

---
The ==direct or assertive voice: Used rarely==. Will cause problems and create pushback. — location: [902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=902) ^ref-38947


Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, — location: [904](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=904) ^ref-28819

---
---
==keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy==. — location: [905](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=905) ^ref-22770


Emotions are one of the main things that derail communication. Once people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out the window. — location: [917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=917) ^ref-53115

---
---
That’s why, ==instead of denying or ignoring emotions, good negotiators identify and influence them==. — location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=919) ^ref-36200

---
They are ==able to precisely label emotions, those of others and especially their own==. — location: [919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=919) ^ref-34843

*here is an important hunch that I need to invest in learning how to label emotions*


Getting to this level of emotional intelligence demands opening up your senses, talking less, and listening more. — location: [924](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=924) ^ref-2122

Empathy is a classic “soft” communication skill, but it has a physical basis. ==When we closely observe a person’s face, gestures, and tone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process called neural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think and feel.== — location: [963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=963) ^ref-44935

And ==“why” can backfire.== Regardless of what language the word “why” is translated into, it’s accusatory. — location: [2458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2458) ^ref-54819

“why” successfully is when the defensiveness that is created ==supports the change you are trying to get them to see. “Why would you ever change from the way you’ve always done things and try my approach?”== is an example. — location: [2460](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2460) ^ref-24764

Here are some other ==great standbys== that I use in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation:         ==■    What about this is important to you?         ■    How can I help to make this better for us?         ■    How would you like me to proceed?         ■    What is it that brought us into this situation?== — location: [2471](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2471) ^ref-17350

And that guides the other party toward designing a solution. Your solution. — location: [2485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2485) ^ref-18755

The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional cool is to bite your tongue. — location: [2539](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2539) ^ref-56582

---
away from knee-jerk, passionate reactions. ==Pause. Think.== — location: [2540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2540) ^ref-21927

Let the passion dissipate. That allows you to ==collect your thoughts and be more circumspect in what you say. It also lowers your chance of saying more than you want== — location: [2540](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2540) ^ref-30433

Another simple rule is, when you are verbally assaulted, ==do not counterattack.== — location: [2544](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2544) ^ref-46364

---
That is, in moments of conflict they react to their lack of power by either becoming extremely defensive or lashing out. — location: [2547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2547) ^ref-32336

in your counterpart by asking a question or even ==offering an apology. (“You’re right. That was a bit harsh.”)== — location: [2553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2553) ^ref-60794

Who has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the guy talking? The listener, of course. — location: [2557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2557) ^ref-9111

Don’t try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. ==Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation.== — location: [2563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2563) ^ref-22805

---
==Avoid questions that can be answered with “Yes” or tiny pieces of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity; you will be expected to give something back.== — location: [2565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2565) ^ref-24640

---
Ask calibrated questions that start with the words “How” or “What.” By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will ==give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information==. — location: [2567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2567) ^ref-21589

---
Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language. — location: [2570](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2570) ^ref-6172

Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart toward solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on devising a solution. — location: [2572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2572) ^ref-62868

they have to dynamically and adaptively design the verbal and nonverbal elements of the negotiation to ==gain both consent and execution==. — location: [2602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2602) ^ref-21651

==“How can we raise that much?”== she asked. Notice that she did not use the word “No.” But she still managed to elegantly deny the kidnappers’ $5 million demand.

---
other key benefit of asking “How?” is, quite literally, that it forces your counterpart to consider and explain how a deal will be implemented. A — location: [2680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2680) ^ref-2917

---
There are two key questions you can ask to push your counterparts to think they are ==defining success their way: “How will we know we’re on track?” and “How will we address things if we find we’re off track?”== — location: [2685](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2685) ^ref-5567

---
When they answer, ==you summarize their answers until you get a “That’s right.” Then you’ll know they’ve bought in.== — location: [2687](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2687) ^ref-6209

---
And when you push for implementation and they say, ==“I’ll try,”== you should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. Because this really means, ==“I plan to fail.”== — location: [2690](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2690) ^ref-33326

---
When you hear either of these, ==dive back in with calibrated “How”== questions ==until they define the terms of successful implementation== in their own voice. — location: [2691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2691) ^ref-46037

But for the most part, there are ==almost always other players, people who can act as deal makers or deal killers.== — location: [2711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2711) ^ref-38565

you have to ==discover how to affect these individuals==. — location: [2712](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=2712) ^ref-39123

So you need to know who is influencing the decision

First, ==pay very close attention to tone and body language to make sure they match up with the literal meaning of the words==.

==Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).         4.      Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.         5.      When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.         6.      On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit.== — location: [3230](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=3230) ^ref-55653
