They seemed to insinuate that the other side was being dishonest and unfair. And that was enough to make them falter and negotiate with themselves. ‚Äî location: [300](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=300) ^ref-53333

---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just asking questions,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a passive-aggressive approach. I just ask the same three or four open-ended questions over and over and over and over. They get worn out answering and give me everything I want.‚Äù ‚Äî location: [303](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=303) ^ref-45710

As you just saw, the beauty of going right after negativity is that it brings us to a safe zone of empathy. ‚Äî location: [1198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=1198) ^ref-64973

==how we dress up our negotiations in mathematical theories, we are always an animal, always acting and reacting first and foremost from our deeply held but mostly invisible and inchoate fears, needs, perceptions, and desires==. ‚Äî location: [312](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=312) ^ref-15327


After all, kidnappers are just businessmen trying to get the best price. ‚Äî location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=322) ^ref-17852

One, separate the person‚Äîthe emotion‚Äîfrom the problem; two, don‚Äôt get wrapped up in the other side‚Äôs position (what they‚Äôre asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they‚Äôre asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions. ‚Äî location: [357](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=357) ^ref-21080

There‚Äôs the ==Framing Effect, which demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed== ‚Äî location: [374](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=374) ^ref-28420

---
==Prospect Theory explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses==. ‚Äî location: [376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=376) ^ref-37611

which shows how ==people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain==. ‚Äî location: [377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=377) ^ref-16376

---
==System 1‚Äôs inchoate beliefs, feelings, and impressions are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2==. ‚Äî location: [381](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=381) ^ref-3104

---
==We react emotionally (System 1) to a suggestion or question. Then that System 1 reaction informs and in effect creates the System 2 answer.== ‚Äî location: [382](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=382) ^ref-33953

---
if you know how to ==affect your counterpart‚Äôs System 1 thinking==, his inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your questions and statements, then you can guide his System 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses. ‚Äî location: [384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=384) ^ref-58730

---

conducting negotiations based on System 2 concepts without the tools to read, understand, and manipulate the System 1 emotional underpinning was like trying to make an omelet without first knowing how to crack an egg. ‚Äî location: [388](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=388) ^ref-61901

provided groundbreaking ideas on cooperative problem solving and originated absolutely necessary concepts like entering negotiations with a ==BATNA: the Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement==. ‚Äî location: [393](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=393) ^ref-8967


then our negotiating skills had to laser-focus on the animal, emotional, and irrational. ‚Äî location: [416](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=416) ^ref-46730

simple psychological tactics and strategies that worked in the field to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs, and persuade the other guy of our empathy. ‚Äî location: [419](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=419) ^ref-37753

These counseling skills were aimed at developing positive relationships with people by demonstrating an understanding of what they‚Äôre going through and how they feel about it. ‚Äî location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=425) ^ref-3065

starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. ‚Äî location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=427) ^ref-23452

---
Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing. ‚Äî location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=427) ^ref-45815

---
when individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings. ‚Äî location: [429](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=429) ^ref-49042

Tactical Empathy. This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person. ‚Äî location: [433](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=433) ^ref-29961

---
---
==The majority of the interactions== we have at work and at home are negotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalistic urge: ==I want.== ‚Äî location: [442](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=442) ^ref-19103

---
==want you to accept that $1 million contract.‚Äù ‚ÄúI want to pay $20,000 for that car.‚Äù ‚ÄúI want you to give me a 10 percent raise.‚Äù== ‚Äî location: [445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=445) ^ref-52734

---
Negotiation is the heart of collaboration. It is what makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties. It can change your life, as it has changed mine. ‚Äî location: [516](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=516) ^ref-46148

---
---
==great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises== they are certain exist. ‚Äî location: [547](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=547) ^ref-18558

---
Experience will have taught them that they are ==best served by holding multiple hypotheses‚Äîabout the situation, about the counterpart‚Äôs wants, about a whole array of variables==‚Äîin their mind at the same time. ‚Äî location: [548](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=548) ^ref-20716

---
they use all the new information that comes their way to test and winnow true hypotheses from false ones. ‚Äî location: [550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=550) ^ref-15923

---
---
You should ==engage the process with a mindset of discovery.== ‚Äî location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=552) ^ref-7604

---

really smart people often have trouble being negotiators‚Äîthey‚Äôre so smart they think they don‚Äôt have anything to discover. ‚Äî location: [553](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=553) ^ref-9020

---
---
==Great negotiators are able to question the assumptions== that the rest of the involved players accept on faith or in arrogance, and thus ==remain more emotionally open to all possibilities, and more intellectually agile to a fluid situation==. ‚Äî location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=557) ^ref-37261

---
==be aware of a counterpart‚Äôs overuse of personal pronouns‚Äîwe/they or me/I. The less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is== (and vice versa). ‚Äî location: [563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=563) ^ref-57506

The thinking behind this policy was that all these extra sets of ears would pick up extra information. ‚Äî location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=584) ^ref-14580

---
tell them, should be a wake-up call. It‚Äôs really not that easy to listen well. ‚Äî location: [590](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=590) ^ref-57983

---
We are easily distracted. We engage in selective listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our minds acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. ‚Äî location: [591](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=591) ^ref-33048

---
Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively. ‚Äî location: [592](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=592) ^ref-24453

---
George A. Miller persuasively put forth the idea that we can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment. In other words, we are easily overwhelmed. ‚Äî location: [595](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=595) ^ref-43870

---
==When they‚Äôre not talking, they‚Äôre thinking about their arguments, and when they are talking, they‚Äôre making their arguments==. ‚Äî location: [597](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=597) ^ref-19753

*So true listening needs focus on the listening and hearing in several dimensions.*

everyone just listening to the voice in their head (and not well, because they‚Äôre doing seven or eight other things at the same time). ‚Äî location: [599](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=599) ^ref-15702

---
make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. ‚Äî location: [602](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=602) ^ref-11100

---
In that mode of true active listening‚Äîaided by the tactics you‚Äôll learn in the following chapters‚Äîyou‚Äôll disarm your counterpart. You‚Äôll make them feel safe. The voice in their head will begin to quiet down. ‚Äî location: [603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=603) ^ref-28865

---
The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want. ‚Äî location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=605) ^ref-4967

---
The latter will help you discover the former. ‚Äî location: [606](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=606) ^ref-54484

---
But neither wants nor needs are where we start; it begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin. ‚Äî location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=608) ^ref-36018

---
The problem was, we were in too much of a hurry, driving too hard toward a quick solution; trying to be a problem solver, not a people mover. ‚Äî location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=629) ^ref-49621

---
make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. ‚Äî location: [889](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=889) ^ref-11100

---
---
==Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making==. If ‚Äî location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=631) ^ref-38432

---
we‚Äôre ==too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they‚Äôre not being heard== and we risk undermining the rapport and trust we‚Äôve built. There‚Äôs plenty of research that now validates the passage of time as one of the most important tools for a negotiator. ‚Äî location: [631](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=631) ^ref-25614

---
==When you slow the process down, you also calm it down.== After all, if someone is talking, they‚Äôre not shooting. ‚Äî location: [633](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=633) ^ref-26001

---
switched into my ==Late-Night, FM DJ Voice: deep, soft, slow, and reassuring==. ‚Äî location: [650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=650) ^ref-10950

When deliberating on a negotiating strategy or approach, people tend to focus all their energies on what to say or do, but it‚Äôs how we are (our general demeanor and delivery) that is both the easiest thing to enact and the most immediately effective mode of influence. ‚Äî location: [657](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=657) ^ref-31372

---

---
That‚Äôs why ==your most powerful tool in any verbal communication is your voice==. ‚Äî location: [665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=665) ^ref-56537
You can use your voice to intentionally reach into someone‚Äôs brain and flip an emotional switch. ‚Äî location: [666](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=666) ^ref-49045

---

---
There are essentially ==three voice tones== available to negotiators: ==the late-night FM DJ voice==, ==the positive/playful voice==, and t==he direct or assertive voice==. ‚Äî location: [668](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=668) ^ref-37591

---
==Most of the time==, you should be using the ==positive/playful voice.== It‚Äôs the ==voice of an easygoing, good-natured person==. ‚Äî location: [671](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=671) ^ref-35043

---
==A smile, even while talking on the phone, has an impact== tonally that the other person will pick up on. ‚Äî location: [673](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=673) ^ref-1990

---
When people are in a ==positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve== (instead of fight and resist). ‚Äî location: [680](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=680) ^ref-24710

---
It applies to the smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: ==a smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility==. ‚Äî location: [681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=681) ^ref-49892

---
==when you inflect your voice in a downward way, you put it out there that you‚Äôve got it covered. Talking slowly and clearly you convey one idea: I‚Äôm in control.== ‚Äî location: [683](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=683) ^ref-29823

When you inflect in an upward way, you invite a response. Why? Because you‚Äôve brought in a measure of uncertainty. You‚Äôve made a statement sound like a question. You‚Äôve left the door open for the other guy to take the lead, ‚Äî location: [684](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=684) ^ref-52302

---
It‚Äôs the same voice I might use in a contract negotiation, when an item isn‚Äôt up for discussion. ‚Äî location: [686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=686) ^ref-23623

---

---
==Mirroring==, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It‚Äôs another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which ==we copy each other to comfort each other==. ‚Äî location: [710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=710) ^ref-11279

---
It can be done ==with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice.== ‚Äî location: [711](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=711) ^ref-6658
profound biological principle: We fear what‚Äôs different and are drawn to what‚Äôs similar. ‚Äî location: [715](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=715) ^ref-13860

---

---
‚ÄúTrust me,‚Äù a mirror signals to another‚Äôs unconscious, ‚Äú==You and I‚Äîwe‚Äôre alike.‚Äù== ‚Äî location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=716) ^ref-39335

---
a ‚Äúmirror‚Äù is when you ==repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words)== of what someone has just said. ‚Äî location: [721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=721) ^ref-31497
your counterpart will inevitably elaborate on what was just said and sustain the process of connecting. ‚Äî location: [724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=724) ^ref-3347

---

---
The other group of ==waiters mirrored their customers simply by repeating their orders back== to them. ‚Äî location: [727](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=727) ^ref-58881

the average tip of the waiters who mirrored was 70 percent more than of those who used positive reinforcement. ‚Äî location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=728) ^ref-5538

---

---
==For a mirror to be effective, you‚Äôve got to let it sit there and do its work==. ‚Äî location: [732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=732) ^ref-1816

The ability to get inside the head‚Äîand eventually under the skin‚Äîof your counterpart depends on these techniques and a willingness to change your approach, based on new evidence, along the way. ‚Äî location: [831](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=831) ^ref-60367

It‚Äôs just four simple steps: ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†==1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Use the late-night FM DJ voice. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Start with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry . . .‚Äù ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Mirror. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Repeat==. One ‚Äî location: [841](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=841) ^ref-27034

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, two copies?‚Äù she mirrored in response, ‚Äî location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=854) ^ref-1890

---

---
The ==intention behind most mirrors should be ‚ÄúPlease, help me understand.‚Äù== Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they‚Äôve said. ‚Äî location: [855](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=855) ^ref-59923
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù her boss responded, ‚Äúone for us and one for the customer.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, so you are saying that the client is asking for a copy and we need a copy for internal use?‚Äù ‚Äî location: [859](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=859) ^ref-34098

---
the technique takes a little practice. Once you get the hang of it, though, it‚Äôll become a conversational Swiss Army knife valuable ‚Äî location: [871](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=871) ^ref-22209

---
The ==language of negotiation is primarily a language of conversation and rapport==: a way of quickly establishing relationships and getting people to talk and think together. ‚Äî location: [873](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=873) ^ref-49215
you‚Äôll see a refined set of powerful skills: a conscious smile to ease the tension, use of subtle verbal and nonverbal language to signal empathy (and thus security), a certain downward inflection in the voice, embrace of specific kinds of questions and avoidance of others‚Äîa whole array of previously hidden skills that will prove invaluable to you, once you‚Äôve learned to use them. ‚Äî location: [879](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=879) ^ref-56630

a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find. ‚Äî location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=884) ^ref-3266

---
==Don‚Äôt commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and use the negotiation to test them rigorously.== ‚Äî location: [885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=885) ^ref-18725

---
Negotiation is not an act of battle; it‚Äôs a process of discovery. The goal is to ==uncover as much information as possible==. ‚Äî location: [888](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=888) ^ref-65251

Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. ‚Äî location: [891](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=891) ^ref-38777

Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve ‚Äî location: [893](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=893) ^ref-38598

==The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow.== When done properly, you create an ==aura of authority and trustworthiness== without triggering defensiveness. ‚Äî location: [897](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=897) ^ref-13913

---
The ==positive/playful voice==: Should be your default voice. ==It‚Äôs the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging.

*here is an important hunch that I need to invest in learning how to label emotions*


Getting to this level of emotional intelligence demands opening up your senses, talking less, and listening more. ‚Äî location: [924](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=924) ^ref-2122

---
---
Empathy is a classic ‚Äúsoft‚Äù communication skill, but it has a physical basis. ==When we closely observe a person‚Äôs face, gestures, and tone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process called neural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think and feel.== ‚Äî location: [963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=963) ^ref-44935

Turn your attention to someone who‚Äôs talking near you, or watch a person being interviewed on TV. ==As they talk, imagine that you are that person==. ‚Äî location: [969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=969) ^ref-31230

Empathy helps us ==learn the position the enemy is in, why their actions make sense (to them), and what might move them==. ‚Äî location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=978) ^ref-56462

==Labeling is a way of validating someone‚Äôs emotion by acknowledging it.== ‚Äî location: [991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=991) ^ref-60865

But when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking.

If you say, ‚ÄúHow is the family?‚Äù and the corners of the other party‚Äôs mouth turn down even when they say it‚Äôs great, you might detect that all is not well; if their voice goes flat when a colleague is mentioned, there could be a problem between the two; and if your landlord unconsciously fidgets his feet when you mention the neighbors, it‚Äôs pretty clear that he doesn‚Äôt think much of them ‚Äî location: [1008](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B014DUR7L2&location=1008) ^ref-60191
