## Highlights
What this means is that for a market-competing or red ocean strategy to succeed, an organization has to make a value-cost trade-off: It can stand out either in value, which is called differentiation (position 1), or in low cost (position 2). But it cannot stand out in both. — location: [206](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=206) ^ref-14385

---
separate market-competing moves—what we call red ocean strategy—from market-creating moves—what we call blue ocean strategy. — location: [250](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=250) ^ref-51715

---
The first component is adopting a blue ocean perspective, so that you expand your horizons and shift your understanding of where opportunity resides. — location: [292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=292) ^ref-35206

---
They raise fundamentally different sets of questions that enable them to see and understand opportunities and risk in fresh and innovative ways. — location: [295](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=295) ^ref-46471

---
Too many organizations are wedded to industry best practices even as they strive to break away from them. — location: [301](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=301) ^ref-19535

---
they lack market-creating tools and guidance to turn their blue ocean perspective into reality. — location: [307](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=307) ^ref-22972

---
The second component, therefore, is having practical tools for market creation with proper guidance on how to apply them to translate a blue ocean perspective into a commercially compelling new offering that creates new market space. — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=308) ^ref-42016

---
How do you challenge the explicit and implicit assumptions you hold regarding your business and your marketplace? How do you go about identifying the ocean of noncustomers to create new demand? How can you systematically redefine market boundaries to open up a new value-cost frontier that makes the competition irrelevant? — location: [314](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=314) ^ref-35212

---
How can you create offerings that stand apart while simultaneously achieving lower costs? — location: [316](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=316) ^ref-43266

---
Accordingly, the third component is having a humanistic process, something we have come to call “humanness” in the process, which inspires and builds people’s confidence to own and drive the process for effective execution. — location: [329](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=329) ^ref-23795

---
First, most organizations treat strategy creation and execution as separate and sequential activities. — location: [338](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=338) ^ref-53039

---
Second, when it comes to execution, most of the time and attention get focused on making structural changes and using carrot and stick approaches, such as changing spans of control, aligning incentives, setting up key performance indicators, and the like. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=340) ^ref-10801

---
Instead of treating execution as something that happens after the strategy has been set, it needs to be built into the strategy from the start or people won’t own it. — location: [344](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=344) ^ref-38642

---
you need to focus on the emotions and psychology of your people, instead of putting most of your energy into manipulating the mechanistic levers of structure, punishments, and rewards. — location: [345](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=345) ^ref-46641

---
At its core, a successful blue ocean shift is fundamentally a humanistic process. It does not deny but instead embraces our humanness in such a way that it makes us more competent and confident than we ever imagined. — location: [355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=355) ^ref-10342

---
The blue ocean shift process accomplishes this not by demanding that anyone change but by easing people’s fears and building their confidence at every step of the way. — location: [359](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=359) ^ref-1135

---
Hence, to describe the act of market creation that embraces both forms of displacement, we coined the term disruptive creation. — location: [469](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=469) ^ref-22498

---
This broader term captures the full, not partial, opportunity space of market creation driven by displacement. — location: [470](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=470) ^ref-5994

---
many new markets have also been created without disrupting existing ones. — location: [473](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=473) ^ref-48321

---
Nondisruptive Creation Also Generates New Markets and Growth — location: [474](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=474) ^ref-21858

---
But did Viagra disrupt another market? Again, the answer is no. It was nondisruptive creation. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=485) ^ref-41664

---
Try this short exercise. Ask a group of people to look around a room for 30 seconds and make a mental note of every red item they see. As soon as the time is up, ask them to close their eyes and recall every blue item they saw. That’s right blue. People will have trouble recalling many items at all. What we look for determines what we see. When we assume that the only way we can create a new market is by disrupting an old one, opportunities for nondisruptive creation can be easily missed. — location: [511](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=511) ^ref-17110

Nice little exercise to sharpen eyes for what we dont focus on

---
People tend to focus their attention on the core of existing markets and what it would take to disrupt the existing order. — location: [515](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=515) ^ref-20584

---
We need a holistic model of market-creating strategy that embraces both disruptive and nondisruptive creations, since they are complementary. — location: [534](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=534) ^ref-45158

---
three basic ways in which market-creating strategies—and hence blue ocean shifts—are made. You can: — location: [542](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=542) ^ref-56047

---
Offer a breakthrough solution for an industry’s existing problem. Redefine an industry’s existing problem and solve it. Identify and solve a brand-new problem or seize a brand-new opportunity. — location: [543](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=543) ^ref-33384

---
Growth occurs with this market re-creation and boundary expansion as the breakthrough solution pulls in new demand, converting once noncustomers into customers. — location: [564](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=564) ^ref-34083

---
Just think, for example, of how many more people today take photos with digital photography than took pictures with film in the past. — location: [565](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=565) ^ref-29531

---
As our growth model indicates, solving a brand-new problem or capturing a brand-new opportunity results in nondisruptive creation because the new market hardly eats at the core, or even the margins, of existing industries. — location: [575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=575) ^ref-47332

---
Take the well-known example of Cirque du Soleil. It made a leap in the kind and degree of value the industry offered by redefining the problem it focused on, from how to maximize the fun and thrill of the circus, to how to combine the best of it—clowns, tents, and amazing acrobats—with the best of theater and ballet—their artistry, music, dance, and story lines. It created a new market space between these industries, drawing a slice of demand from each. At the same time, it enlarged the overall pie by pulling new people into this blue ocean of newly created market space. — location: [584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=584) ^ref-4870

---
And redefining and solving an existing problem draws on elements of both disruptive and nondisruptive creations. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=608) ^ref-30631

---
While technology innovators may lay extraordinary eggs, they are seldom the ones who ultimately hatch them. — location: [617](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=617) ^ref-10115

---
But the key lesson to remember here is that to succeed in creating a new market, your focus must be on offering a quantum leap in value for buyers, not on technology innovation per se. — location: [629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=629) ^ref-48452

---
“One of the hardest truths for any technologist to hear is that success or failure in business is rarely determined by the quality of the technology.” — location: [647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=647) ^ref-39981

---
Value innovation anchors innovation to the value it gives buyers, not to the cleverness of the technology. — location: [659](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=659) ^ref-5613

---
Yet when we dig deep, we find that even when companies deliberately set out to create new markets, those efforts are usually geared less toward getting out of red oceans and more toward making further investments in existing, overcrowded markets. — location: [667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=667) ^ref-8847

---
Or is it more likely that the more it focused on benchmarking and outpacing the competition, the more its strategy would simply have looked like the competition’s? Is this something your organization does all too often, too? — location: [745](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=745) ^ref-59687

---
your existing customers keep you focused on what is, instead of what could be? — location: [750](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=750) ^ref-34285

---
Do you act on the assumption that, to achieve differentiation you need to spend more, while to win through low costs you need to compromise on the distinctive value you can offer? — location: [754](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=754) ^ref-3652

---
do not take industry conditions as given. Rather, they set out to reshape them in their favor. — location: [803](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=803) ^ref-54154

---
Most executives build their strategies on the basis of these assessments. In other words, structure shapes strategy.1 This view of strategy is deterministic in that: (1) It treats an organization’s strategic options as limited by the environment; and (2) it bounds executives’ imaginations by the industry’s current conditions. — location: [806](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=806) ^ref-57840

---
They refuse to take existing industry conditions as givens. Nor do they blame those conditions for their difficulties. They look to themselves for answers, and don’t let industry conditions frame their understanding of what is possible and profitable. — location: [828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=828) ^ref-8479

---
And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. — location: [833](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=833) ^ref-12533

---
Blue ocean strategists do not seek to beat the competition. Instead they aim to make the competition irrelevant. — location: [839](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=839) ^ref-58313

---
Most organizations are stuck in the trap of competing. — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=840) ^ref-30297

---
because it leads to imitative, not innovative, approaches to the market. — location: [844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=844) ^ref-37295

---
At first glance this appears reasonable. If winning organizations have competitive advantages, pursuing a competitive advantage would seem to be the direct path to achieving — location: [850](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=850) ^ref-30761

---
problem is one of framing. When managers are urged to secure a competitive advantage, what are they likely to do? They automatically look to the competition, assess what their competitors do, and strive to do it better. — location: [852](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=852) ^ref-28057

---
But, in so doing, their strategic thinking unknowingly regresses toward the competition. — location: [853](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=853) ^ref-32367

---
The competition becomes the defining variable of strategy, not buyer value. — location: [854](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=854) ^ref-6952

---
What would it take to win over the mass of buyers, even with no marketing? — location: [861](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=861) ^ref-15105

---
It’s just that their aim is to push their organizations to create offerings so compelling that anyone who sees them or tries them can’t help but rave about them. — location: [862](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=862) ^ref-60915

---
It causes managers to fundamentally challenge and rethink all the factors an industry competes on and invests in, and to push for a quantum leap in value. — location: [869](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=869) ^ref-4818

---
Blue ocean strategists focus on creating and capturing new demand, not fighting over existing customers. — location: [874](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=874) ^ref-29526

---
For all its strength, however, this drive to improve customers’ satisfaction scores also tends to keep organizations anchored in the red ocean of existing market space. — location: [881](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=881) ^ref-14493

---
While this focus on existing customers is fine when industries are growing, it starts to impose real limits when demand is stagnant or in decline. — location: [885](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=885) ^ref-8804

---
Moreover, when you ask existing customers, “How can we make you happier?” their insights tend toward the familiar, such as “Offer me more for less.” — location: [889](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=889) ^ref-16087

---
Instead of fighting to win a greater percentage of existing customers, blue ocean strategists seek to create new demand by looking to noncustomers. — location: [895](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=895) ^ref-6427

---
Blue ocean strategists simultaneously pursue differentiation and low cost. They aim to break, not make, the value-cost trade-off. — location: [902](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=902) ^ref-8222

---
blue ocean strategists focus as much on what to eliminate and reduce as they do on what to raise and create. — location: [917](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=917) ^ref-19528

---

We aspire to make a difference. — location: [932](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=932) ^ref-21286

---
This includes people at the top, whose egos are often the most fragile of all. — location: [938](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=938) ^ref-17735

Humanness builds psychological understanding into the strategic process so that people are willing to engage fully at every step — location: [942](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=942) ^ref-29668

---
When we feel genuinely understood and appreciated for who we are as whole people, when we feel respected not because we are brilliant, bold, and perfect, but because we have something to contribute and want to make a difference despite our insecurities and vulnerabilities, we stop feeling like imposters with something to hide. — location: [944](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=944) ^ref-12569

---
Humanness, in short, builds our confidence to act by eliciting our emotional engagement. — location: [948](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=948) ^ref-10445

---
It inspires us to tap into our curiosity and creativity, — location: [949](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=949) ^ref-3117

---
An organization that has the confidence to make a blue ocean shift but lacks the knowledge of how to get there is like a gambler. It can expect lots of misdirected efforts and failed attempts. — location: [962](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=962) ^ref-25570

---
That is, not with one great leap. Instead, you break the challenge down into small, concrete steps that move people forward in increments that inspire and build their confidence. — location: [973](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=973) ^ref-53110

---
We call this atomization after Einstein’s reflection that if you deconstruct any challenge into its basic components, or atoms, and focus on solving them one at a time, even the largest challenge shifts from being overwhelming to being intellectually and psychologically solvable. — location: [978](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=978) ^ref-46482

Creating the conditions that will enable people to discover for themselves, firsthand, the need for change, instead of being told, is the answer that emerges from our research. — location: [991](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=991) ^ref-29379

---
First, people are handed no predetermined conclusions. Rather, at each step, people are given tools that allow them to arrive at the answers themselves. — location: [993](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=993) ^ref-57384

---
With no predetermined conclusions, people don’t feel manipulated. — location: [995](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=995) ^ref-38506

The process achieves this by creatively putting you and your team face-to-face with the market, — location: [998](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=998) ^ref-32591

---
It moves us from the unsettling, highly vulnerable mindset of “I don’t know” to the quietly confident one of “I know,” not because we have been briefed by a report or told by a third-party focus group, but because we saw and experienced it for ourselves. — location: [1003](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1003) ^ref-4599

engagement, explanation, and clear expectations. — location: [1011](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1011) ^ref-22567

---
Engagement means actively involving people in strategic decisions that affect them by asking for their input and allowing them to refute and challenge the merits of one another’s ideas and assumptions. — location: [1013](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1013) ^ref-9225

---
Explanation means providing people with a clear account of the thinking that underlies the process and the strategic decisions reached at each step. — location: [1016](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1016) ^ref-42843

---
Explanation reassures people that their opinions have been considered, and decisions have been made with the company’s overall interests at heart. — location: [1017](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1017) ^ref-12955

---
Lastly, clear expectations means just that: stating clearly what people can expect, and what their roles and responsibilities are, at each step and in moving forward after the process is complete. — location: [1019](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1019) ^ref-1187

Traditionally, leaders have used two measures to assess the strength of an organization’s portfolio of offerings: market share and industry attractiveness. — location: [1177](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1177) ^ref-25282

---
Market share is important. And most organizations want more of it. But market share is a lagging indicator. It’s a reflection of past, not future, performance. — location: [1180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1180) ^ref-14576

The pioneer-migrator-settler map largely gets around these issues by replacing market share and industry attractiveness with “value” and “innovation.” — location: [1188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1188) ^ref-8664

The value you deliver today drives buyer behavior, which determines your future growth prospects, — location: [1190](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1190) ^ref-7443

---
Innovation, on the other hand, is key because it allows you to overcome existing industry conditions. Without it, companies are stuck in the trap of competitive improvements. — location: [1192](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1192) ^ref-6716

---
What you want to understand is this: which of your offerings or businesses are “me-toos” that offer only imitative value; which are better than competitors’ but only marginally so, delivering improved value; — location: [1199](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1199) ^ref-12169

---
and which, if any, are value innovations that deliver a true leap in value. — location: [1201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1201) ^ref-56573

---
Pioneers are businesses or offerings that represent value innovations. They don’t have customers; they have fans. They offer unprecedented value that opens up a new value-cost frontier. These are the businesses or offerings that hold the key to renewing your portfolio. Their strategy breaks away from the competition. Pioneers are poised for strong, profitable growth. — location: [1202](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1202) ^ref-37168

---
Settlers are the other extreme. These are businesses or offerings that offer value imitation. They compete by making incremental changes to an offering or its price. — location: [1205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1205) ^ref-53891

---
Migrators lie somewhere in between. They represent a value improvement over the competition and may even be best in class. But they do not offer innovative value. — location: [1207](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=1207) ^ref-58171

Blue ocean moves seldom involve lots of bells and whistles, nor are the ideas usually fancy and shiny. In fact, once they’re completed, they often look remarkably simple and clear and have the ring of common sense.

On the one hand, otherwise good ideas are couched in such complex and incoherent language that it’s impossible to judge their merits. On the other hand, seemingly good ideas are either all about being different for the sake of differentiation and don’t actually offer buyers a leap in value, or they lack a robust profit proposition. — location: [3142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=3142) ^ref-5282

we hear are how professional and easy to grasp the strategic offerings are, and how clearly the presentations lay out the benefits for buyers and for the organization. — location: [3146](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=3146) ^ref-51731

We set a tight time limit here, because we’ve found that any strategy that takes longer than this to communicate effectively is probably too complicated, or not well enough thought through, or too undistinguished to be any good. — location: [3195](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=3195) ^ref-10297

Describe the offering: Start by presenting the offering’s tagline. Follow this with a short, bullet-point description. This should be very easy to understand, so that the attendees can immediately grasp the gist of the offering and why it is compelling. Present the to-be strategy canvas: — location: [3201](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=3201) ^ref-57923

Does the offering fail to eliminate and reduce factors sufficiently to drive lower costs and break the value-cost trade-off? Is there a lower-cost way to deliver any of the factors proposed to be raised or created that could strengthen the offering’s economic benefits? — location: [3258](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B06XCMHWY1&location=3258) ^ref-46670
