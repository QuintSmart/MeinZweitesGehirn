# Habit
Habits are defined as **automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues**. Done with little or no conscious thought.

Habits form when the brain takes a shortcut and stops actively deliberating over what to do next. The brain quickly learns to codify behaviors that provide a solution to whatever situation it encounters.

A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of discomfort.

Habit-forming products alleviate usersâ€™ discomfort by relieving a pronounced itch.

**Higher CLTV** - resulting from user habits that  **increase how long and how frequently customers use a product**.

As customers form routines around a product, they come to depend upon it and become **less sensitive to price**.

Having a greater proportion of users daily returning to a service dramatically decreases [[Viral Cycle Time]] for two reasons: 
* First, daily users **initiate loops more often** (think tagging a friend in a Facebook photo)
* Second, **more daily active users means more people to respond** and react to each invitation.
