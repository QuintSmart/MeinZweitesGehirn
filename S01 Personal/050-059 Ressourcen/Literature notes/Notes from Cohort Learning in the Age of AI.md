## 5 Key points
+ Workers Leave Employers Who Shortchange Development
	+ Career development as key factor for selecting an employer
	+ around 50% likely leave an employer if they don't invest in their development
+ Onboarding is becoming a strategic function
	+ Hybrid or remote workers see cohort-based learning as a critical chance to connect with their teams and stay current on their company‚Äôs latest offerings, initiatives, and strategies.
+ Gen Z and millennials want to learn from peers, not trainers
+ It Takes Scale, Security, and Engagement to Build Community within Your Ecosystem
	+ Companies benefit from not just the day-to-day output of individuals but the effects of their interactions across their teams, business units, and organizations. A decentralized but empowered learning community at the frontline also helps organizations build a workforce that more closely mirrors the customers they serve.
+ AI Is Already at Work, but Many Have Fears for the Future
	+ The most common ways of using AI for learning include providing feedback to learners, create new written training content, and to use in new hire orientation.
	+ 65% of the tasks that a manager currently does have the potential to be automated by 2025. This will create space for managers to build more human relationships with their employees. In the face of ambiguity and uncertainty, leaders can help people overcome their fears, inspire trust, and encourage aligned action across a team

## 5 Actions
* Harness the power of relationships in your organization through cohort-based learning. 
	* Knowledge shifts perspective, tests long-held beliefs and inspires growth when debated, reflected upon, and shared. Leverage the strength of each learner‚Äôs entire experience ‚Äì not only expert knowledge‚Äìto enhance their development
* Shift from ‚Äútransactional Onboarding‚Äù to ‚Äústrategic Everboarding‚Äù
	* Roles, teams, and whole functions are constantly evolving, especially with the collision of industries and the advent of the cyber-physical era. Cohort-based learning rapidly sets every employee on the fast track for a deeply integrated, high-performing workforce in which peers and peer-generated content are unleashed to their full effect. Bring knowledge, coaching, teamwork, and discussion together cohesively, accelerating performance and team alignment.
* Create a rich, sensory, immersive learning experience that appeals to the ‚Äúheart‚Äù and the ‚Äúhead.‚Äù
	* From digital adoption platforms that teach people how to use software to scenario-based video practice where learners can practice their soft skills, remote learning can be more profound, richer, and more inclusive than in-person. Seize the opportunity and consider integrating music, humor, storytelling, and powerful visuals. Embrace mobile to make the experience seamless.
