# Memory palace and AI

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS_BgFuUohA)

+ Memory and magician activities go together
+ kinestatic memory - learning from movement and touching things
+ be comfortable enough to be in the moment (there memory helps)
+ learning how our brains work, learning how our memory works is super beneficial
	+ to be a well rounded version e.g. on conversations
+ be prepared to engage in the dialectics
	+ defend yourself in discussions
+ always focus on what can go right
+ the mindmaos is what we create and the process of creating this matters
+ 30' reading - 30' engaging - 30' acting on it
+ have a song created for knowledge by AI - to better memorize
+ where is my freedom - as ChatGPT limits what it will discuss about
+ ChatGPT takes away the embarrasment with learning
+ "memory is being"
+ when do I need to offload and when do I need to build my own structure
+ invent your own art of memory
+ the work itself is the thing that matters
