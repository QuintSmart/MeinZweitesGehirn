# Notes from Hone - Collaborative Learning
Main group **==human interaction==**
+ soft skills
+ people skills
+ manager skills
+ leadership skills
+ power skills

Research shows - best results come from blended approaches of self paces and collaborative learning. (What research?)

Benefits of collaborative learning:
+ realistic practices
+ motivation
+ scaling effects
+ human connection

Live virtual collaborative learning (compared to on site) reduces cost in:
+ training facility
+ accommodations for learners and/or facilitators
+ travel
+ time spent not working while traveling

Measurements:
+ NPS
+ program completion in percent
+ **==percentage of learners exhibiting performance improvements==** in 1+ skills (assessed by colleagues)

Hones approach for the sessions:
+ provide a mental model (way of thinking about a topic)
+ model or role play skills
+ get people practicing skills together
+ expose learners to diverse perspectives from colleagues OR industry peers
+ answer questions and coach learners through challenges
+ get people thinking about the future - What am I going to do with this?

**==Collaborative learning - practice of people learning together, either co-constructing new knowledge or learning from each other.==** Five essential elements by Roger and David Johnson:
+ promotive interaction - discuss concepts, group work while seeing each other
+ positive interdependence - through group exercises where people rely on each other
+ individual and group accountability - cameras on, full participation
+ use of social skills - asking questions to each other and providing feedback to each other
+ group processing -  discussion among the group how well they are working together to achieve their goals

Combined with asynchronous collaboration, with time to:
+ digest material and 
+ formulate new ideas

vs. term Social Learning ... people learn by imitating each other's behavior.
vs. term Cohort-based learning ... does not describe the quality of the experience. What **==makes cohorts effective is collaborative learning==**! Cohorts enable group practices, accountability, exposure to viewpoints, opportunity for feedback and advice.

**==So we provide collaborative learning delivered through virtual cohort based group coaching.**==

Three major benefits of collaborative learning
## Realistic practice for skills of human interaction
Through practices like coaching, role playing, giving feedback - can be more easily and effectively applied through live settings.

Realistic practice for human interaction means interacting with one or more people in a live learning environment.

### Advantages for virtual live settings:
+ Breakout rooms - less time spent moving rooms, no shouting over other groups
+ Fast guiding of groups attention
+ Easy working with Solo Space - camera off and mute themselves

## Motivation for behavior change
**==COM-B model ==**by Susan Michie - behavior (B) is a result of the interaction of Capability (C), Opportunity (O) and Motivation (M).

+ learning targets capability
+ **==collaborative learning leverages motivation==**
	+ shared accountability in small group work
	+ social comparison - what others achieves, and how they overcame challenges
	+ others approval through mentors or peers for your contributions and reflections
	+ emotional support - by offering each other empathetic understanding and encouragement
## Psychological safety at scale
+ though live experiences 
+ message via hearing each other, admitting to challenges or weaknesses, sharing goals and aspirations that everyone has something to learn 
	+ build a strong foundation that your can take risks

## 10 collaborative learning strategies
We try to get people:
+ attend our programs
+ participate
+ acquire new knowledge
+ build new skills
+ transfer skill to real work situations
+ build durable habits

**==Learning Transfer Evaluation Model (LTEM)==** by Dr. Will Thalheimer.

### Mandate enrollment (but offer flexibility)
+ break the busyness barrier
+ Hone uses forced enrollment + flexibility (that might also explain why they start with 50 participants)
+ multiple makeup options and sessions at different times of day
+ reach >90% attendance and program completion

### Get Executives sponsors to sell the benefits of the program
The right **==executive endorsement will capture the attention of learners==**.
Executives should communicate:
+ What am I going to get out of this program?
+ How is it going to make my life easier or better? (LB5)
+ Why is it important to the company?

E.g. via dropping in for a session or being a **==mentor==**. Or providing a testimonial after running through a program themselves.

Avoid: Managers in breakouts with their direct reports.

### Launch around a shared moment of need
**==Moment of need: an event, a deadline, a significant date coming up==**.
+ HRIS moment - joining or promotions
+ Calendar moments - e.g. annual performance reviews, quarterly planning
+ Recurring moments like interviews, kickoffs
+ Change moments
	+ launches, expansions

Consider temporal landmarks like:
+ First day of month
+ Mondays
+ First day of spring, summer, fall, winter
+ anniversaries

One can **==create that need e.g. via a diagnostic assessment or a 180 survey==** - then tie a learning program to the results.

### Engagement
+ set house agreements 
	+ keep video on when possible
	+ be an active participant
	+ step out of your comfort-zone
	+ treat others with respect
	+ uphold confidentiality

Great starter questions: **==On a scale of 1-5, how engaged do you plan to be in the session today? What would it take to increase that number by 1?==**

#### Richard E. Mayer - 12 principles for effective learning content
+ Coherence - eliminate use of irrelevant images, slide decorations
+ Signaling - highlight or bold essential text or add elements one at a time
+ avoid Redundancy - explain it verbally without also providing a textual explanation on the slide
+ Spatial Contiguity - place related elements close 
+ Temporal Contiguity - present related material simultaneously (e.g. instructions in breakout session alongside a model)
+ Pre-Training - introduce key concepts/terminology before details (either before or at the start of a class)
+ Modality - balance how much you say, have to read and use images - optimize cognitive load
+ Multimedia - combine e.g. words and images
+ Segmenting - break content into segments. With a meaningful interaction every 5 minutes - to access understanding 
+ Use human voice - using coaching and facilitation
+ Personalization - use conversational language
+ Image - switch from Slide presentation to Image of facilitator when e.g. doing debriefs

### Keep session between 30' to 120'
Basic Rest-Activity Cycle (BRAC)

BRAC represent a natural ebb and flow of our psychological and cognitive functions. Be careful with amount of information provided. Too much or too less harms consolidation into long term memory.

### Skill building
Research supports first learning from direct instruction, then fading guidance over time. 
Working with a model in the beginning helps learners comprehend and remember each of the steps. Models help lessen cognitive load for group activities that follow.

Use scaffolding - offer support through an exercise - examples:
+ present a problem and talk about steps they would take to approach it
+ present a case study and prompt learners to think step by step how to apply the model/framework to the example
+ Guide a learner through a low-difficulty role play + discuss with the whole group

Practice lab (where knowledge was acquired before) - more activity based, with less direct instructions and more feedback and coaching.

### Facilitate independent practice or actual work
+ let them do individual practice, best to immediately apply to their actual work - combined with group exercises of presentation and explanations for their decisions, rejected alternatives, underlying assumptions and plans for validation
+ or - have people brainstorm individually, then discuss all of the ideas as a group

### Use breakouts
Approaches:
+ present the work they did, partners give feedback or coaching
+ answer to prompts provided
+ two people role play with a 3rd being the observer
+ Group does an activity together and present their results
+ 10-12' per breakout, 30' in a 1h session including debriefing

### Have learners make commitment during class
+ to reflect on and synthesize what they learned
+ plan on how to implement it
+ feel an obligation to follow through

**==have them make a commitment before the class is over==**
- via a **commitment survey 3-5 minutes before the end of the class**
- **==use if-then, when-then statements==**

examples:
+ When I have 1:1s with my direct reports, I am going to dedicate 5 minutes to coaching them toward a goal.

+ When my colleagues send me their work to review, I am going to give them substantive feedback within 3 days.

+ When we do our weekly team meeting, I will spend the first 5 minutes recognizing the hard work of specific individuals on the team.

A good action is specific and simple.

Goals - Situation - Action
+ In what situation do you begin to take action toward the goal?
+ What specific action will you take in the situation?
